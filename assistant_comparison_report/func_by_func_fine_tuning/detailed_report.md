## Overall Conclusion

Based on the analysis, the following conclusions can be drawn:

1. The models `erc-20-721-1155-001-5-16`, `erc-20-1155-001-5-16` and `erc-1155-001-5-16` demonstrated the highest overall verification rates.
2. Fine-tuning generally improved performance compared to the baseline `4o-mini` model (verification rate: 0.00%).
3. The optimal hyperparameters appear to be a learning rate of 0.116, 1155 epochs, and a batch size of 1.
4. Successful verification attempts are significantly faster than failed attempts, suggesting that early success indicators can help determine when a model is likely to produce valid postconditions.
