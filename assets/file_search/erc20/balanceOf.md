#### balanceOf

**Function Purpose**: Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

**ERC-20 Specification**: This is a read-only function that provides access to token balances for any address.

**State Variable Usage**:
- Reads from `_balances[_owner]` mapping
- Does not modify any state variables (view function)

**Expected Behavior**:
- Returns the exact token balance for the specified owner
- Should return 0 for addresses that have never received tokens
- Should never revert under normal circumstances

**Related Functions**:
- Used by `transfer()` and `transferFrom()` to check available balances
- Balance changes are made by token transfer functions

**Postcondition Requirements**:
- The return value must equal `_balances[_owner]`
- Must use exact parameter names: `_owner`, `balance`
- Should be a simple direct mapping access
