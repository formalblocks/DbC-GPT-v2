/**
    * Description: Allows the designated trustedVerifier account to set or revoke the “verified” status of an on-chain identity. This function centralizes verification authority in a trusted off-chain party, enabling attestations (or de-attestations) of an identity’s authenticity without exposing or modifying the underlying data hash.
    * Parameters:
    * - `identityId`: The unique identifier for the identity to be verified.
    * - `verified`: A boolean value indicating whether the identity is verified.
    * Events:
    * - `IdentityVerified`: Emitted when a verification action occurs.
    * - `owner`: The address of the identity’s owner (identities[identityId].owner).
    * - `identityId`: The identifier of the identity.
    * - `verified`: The new verification flag.
