Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.

Your task is to annotate the function in the contract below:


```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {
// Mapping from token ID to account balances
mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

// Mapping from account to operator approvals
mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

/**
    @notice Enable or disable approval for a third party ("operator") to manage all of the caller's tokens.
    @dev MUST emit the ApprovalForAll event on success.
    @param _operator  Address to add to the set of authorized operators
    @param _approved  True if the operator is approved, false to revoke approval
*/

$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) public;
}
```

        @dev MUST emit the ApprovalForAll event on success.
        @param _operator  Address to add to the set of authorized operators
        @param _approved  True if the operator is approved, false to revoke approval
    */
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

    /**
        @notice Queries the approval status of an operator for a given owner.
        @param _owner     The owner of the tokens
        @param _operator  Address of authorized operator
        @return           True if the operator is approved, false if not
    */
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool);
</eip>

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?

The error messages indicate that the postcondition provided may not be correctly formatted for the `solc-verify` tool. Specifically, the issue seems to stem from how the postcondition references the state of the contract and the parameters.

To ensure that the postcondition is valid, we can use the `__verifier_old_bool` function to reference the previous state of the approval status for the operator. The correct postcondition should check that if the approval status changes, it reflects the new value provided in the function call.

Here’s the corrected version of the function with the appropriate postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {
// Mapping from token ID to account balances
mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

// Mapping from account to operator approvals
mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

/**
    @notice Enable or disable approval for a third party ("operator") to manage all of the caller's tokens.
    @dev MUST emit the ApprovalForAll event on success.
    @param _operator  Address to add to the set of authorized operators
    @param _approved  True if the operator is approved, false to revoke approval
*/

/// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
/// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] != __verifier_old_bool(_operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator]) || _approved == __verifier_old_bool(_operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator])
function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) public;
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **First Postcondition**: 
   - `_operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved` ensures that the approval status for the operator is set to the value provided in the function call.

2. **Second Postcondition**: 
   - This checks that if the approval status changes (i.e., it was different before the function call), it reflects the new value. The use of `__verifier_old_bool` allows us to reference the previous state of the approval status.

These conditions should satisfy the requirements of the `solc-verify` tool and correctly represent the expected behavior of the `setApprovalForAll` function.
