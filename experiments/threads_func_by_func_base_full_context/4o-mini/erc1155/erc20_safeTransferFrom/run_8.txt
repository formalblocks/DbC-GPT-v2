=== USER [2025-05-30 11:08:49] ===
Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.

Your task is to annotate the function in the contract below:

```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
1. **_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value**: This postcondition ensures that the balance of the `_from` address decreases by the amount transferred (`_value`).
2. **_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value**: This postcondition ensures that the balance of the `_to` address increases by the amount received (`_value`). 

These postconditions accurately reflect the expected state changes after the execution of the `safeTransferFrom` function, adhering to the requirements outlined in the EIP documentation.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-30 11:09:09] ===
The errors you're encountering indicate that the postconditions are incorrectly referencing the `_balances` mapping. Specifically, the postconditions are trying to compare the mapping directly to a `uint256`, which is not valid. 

To fix this, we need to ensure that we are referencing the balances for a specific token ID, as the `_balances` mapping is a nested mapping that requires both the token ID and the address to access the balance. 

Here’s the corrected version of the postconditions for the `safeTransferFrom` function:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {
// Mapping from token ID to account balances
mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

// Mapping from account to operator approvals
mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

/**
    @notice Transfers `_value` amount of an `_id` from the `_from` address to the `_to` address specified (with safety call).
    @dev Caller must be approved to manage the tokens being transferred out of the `_from` account (see "Approval" section of the standard).
    MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.
    MUST revert if balance of holder for token `_id` is lower than the `_value` sent.
    MUST revert on any other error.
    MUST emit the `TransferSingle` event to reflect the balance change (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).
    After the above conditions are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0). If so, it MUST call `onERC1155Received` on `_to` and act appropriately (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).        
    @param _from    Source address
    @param _to      Target address
    @param _id      ID of the token type
    @param _value   Transfer amount
    @param _data    Additional data with no specified format, MUST be sent unaltered in call to `onERC1155Received` on `_to`
*/

/// @notice postcondition _balances[_id][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) - _value
/// @notice postcondition _balances[_id][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_to]) + _value
function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **_balances[_id][_from]**: This postcondition now correctly references the balance of the `_from` address for the specific token ID `_id`. It checks that the balance decreases by `_value`.
2. **_balances[_id][_to]**: Similarly, this postcondition checks that the balance of the `_to` address for the specific token ID `_id` increases by `_value`.

These changes ensure that the postconditions are valid and accurately reflect the state changes after the execution of the `safeTransferFrom` function.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-30 11:09:28] ===
The error message indicates that the postcondition `_balances[_id][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) - _value` might not hold at the end of the function. This suggests that the balance of `_from` may not necessarily decrease by `_value` due to various conditions that could lead to the function reverting before the transfer occurs.

To address this, we need to ensure that the postconditions only apply if the transfer is successful. This can be done by adding a condition that checks whether the transfer was successful. 

Here's the revised version of the postconditions for the `safeTransferFrom` function:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {
// Mapping from token ID to account balances
mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

// Mapping from account to operator approvals
mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

/**
    @notice Transfers `_value` amount of an `_id` from the `_from` address to the `_to` address specified (with safety call).
    @dev Caller must be approved to manage the tokens being transferred out of the `_from` account (see "Approval" section of the standard).
    MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.
    MUST revert if balance of holder for token `_id` is lower than the `_value` sent.
    MUST revert on any other error.
    MUST emit the `TransferSingle` event to reflect the balance change (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).
    After the above conditions are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0). If so, it MUST call `onERC1155Received` on `_to` and act appropriately (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).        
    @param _from    Source address
    @param _to      Target address
    @param _id      ID of the token type
    @param _value   Transfer amount
    @param _data    Additional data with no specified format, MUST be sent unaltered in call to `onERC1155Received` on `_to`
*/

/// @notice postcondition ( __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) >= _value ) ==> _balances[_id][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) - _value
/// @notice postcondition ( __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) >= _value ) ==> _balances[_id][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_to]) + _value
function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Conditional Postconditions**: The postconditions now include a condition that checks if the old balance of `_from` for the token ID `_id` is greater than or equal to `_value`. This ensures that the postconditions only apply if the transfer is valid and would not revert due to insufficient balance.
   - `(__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) >= _value) ==> _balances[_id][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) - _value`: This means that if the old balance is sufficient, then the new balance must reflect the deduction of `_value`.
   - `(__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) >= _value) ==> _balances[_id][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_to]) + _value`: This means that if the old balance is sufficient, then the new balance of `_to` must reflect the addition of `_value`.

These changes should resolve the verification issue by ensuring that the postconditions are only checked under valid transfer conditions.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-30 11:09:45] ===
The errors you're encountering indicate that the syntax used in the postconditions is incorrect. Specifically, the `==>` operator is not valid in the context of solc-verify annotations. Instead, we need to use the negation approach to express the implications.

Let's revise the postconditions to use the correct syntax and ensure they are valid for the `safeTransferFrom` function:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {
// Mapping from token ID to account balances
mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

// Mapping from account to operator approvals
mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

/**
    @notice Transfers `_value` amount of an `_id` from the `_from` address to the `_to` address specified (with safety call).
    @dev Caller must be approved to manage the tokens being transferred out of the `_from` account (see "Approval" section of the standard).
    MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.
    MUST revert if balance of holder for token `_id` is lower than the `_value` sent.
    MUST revert on any other error.
    MUST emit the `TransferSingle` event to reflect the balance change (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).
    After the above conditions are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0). If so, it MUST call `onERC1155Received` on `_to` and act appropriately (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).        
    @param _from    Source address
    @param _to      Target address
    @param _id      ID of the token type
    @param _value   Transfer amount
    @param _data    Additional data with no specified format, MUST be sent unaltered in call to `onERC1155Received` on `_to`
*/

/// @notice postcondition !( __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) < _value ) || _balances[_id][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) - _value
/// @notice postcondition !( __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) < _value ) || _balances[_id][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_to]) + _value
function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Negation for Implication**: The postconditions now use the negation approach to express the implications:
   - `!( __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) < _value ) || _balances[_id][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) - _value`: This means that if the old balance of `_from` is sufficient (not less than `_value`), then the new balance must reflect the deduction of `_value`.
   - `!( __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) < _value ) || _balances[_id][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_to]) + _value`: This means that if the old balance of `_from` is sufficient, then the new balance of `_to` must reflect the addition of `_value`.

These changes should resolve the verification issues by ensuring that the postconditions are correctly formatted and logically sound.
