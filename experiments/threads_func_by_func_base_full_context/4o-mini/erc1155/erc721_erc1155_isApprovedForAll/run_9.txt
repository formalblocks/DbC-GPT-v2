=== USER [2025-05-30 12:02:34] ===
Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.

Your task is to annotate the function in the contract below:


```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {
// Mapping from token ID to account balances
mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

// Mapping from account to operator approvals
mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;
/**
    @notice Queries the approval status of an operator for a given owner.
    @param _owner     The owner of the tokens
    @param _operator  Address of authorized operator
    @return           True if the operator is approved, false if not
*/

$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);
}
```

EIP markdown below:
<eip>
/**
        @notice Queries the approval status of an operator for a given owner.
        @param _owner     The owner of the tokens
        @param _operator  Address of authorized operator
        @return           True if the operator is approved, false if not
    */
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool);
</eip>

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-30 12:02:37] ===
Here is the updated contract interface with the appropriate postconditions added for the `isApprovedForAll` function:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {
// Mapping from token ID to account balances
mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

// Mapping from account to operator approvals
mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;
/**
    @notice Queries the approval status of an operator for a given owner.
    @param _owner     The owner of the tokens
    @param _operator  Address of authorized operator
    @return           True if the operator is approved, false if not
*/

/// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator] == approved
function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);
}
```

### Explanation of the Postcondition:
- The postcondition `/// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator] == approved` ensures that the return value `approved` accurately reflects the approval status stored in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping for the given `_owner` and `_operator`. This aligns with the expected behavior as described in the EIP documentation.

=== USER [2025-05-30 12:02:48] ===

            Verification failed for function `function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);`

            The verifier found the following errors:
            ```
            Warning: This is a pre-release compiler version, please do not use it in production.
spec.sol:27:5: Error: Function, variable, struct or modifier declaration expected.
    - The postcondition `/// @notice pos ...
    ^

            ```

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-30 12:02:50] ===
It appears that the postcondition syntax needs to be adjusted to ensure it is correctly formatted for the Solidity compiler. The postcondition should be prefixed with `/// @notice` to avoid any parsing issues. Here’s the corrected version of the contract interface:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {
// Mapping from token ID to account balances
mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

// Mapping from account to operator approvals
mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;
/**
    @notice Queries the approval status of an operator for a given owner.
    @param _owner     The owner of the tokens
    @param _operator  Address of authorized operator
    @return           True if the operator is approved, false if not
*/

/// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator] == approved
function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) public view returns (bool approved);
}
```

### Key Changes:
- The postcondition remains the same, but it is crucial to ensure that the syntax is strictly followed without any additional formatting issues.
- Ensure that there are no stray characters or formatting issues that could lead to parsing errors in the Solidity compiler. 

This should resolve the verification issue you encountered.
