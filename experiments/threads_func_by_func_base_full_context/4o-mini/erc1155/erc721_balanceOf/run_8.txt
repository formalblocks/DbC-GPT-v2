=== USER [2025-05-30 10:54:11] ===
Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.

Your task is to annotate the function in the contract below:


```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {
// Mapping from token ID to account balances
mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

// Mapping from account to operator approvals
mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

/**
    @notice Get the balance of an account's tokens.
    @param _owner  The address of the token holder
    @param _id     ID of the token
    @return        The _owner's balance of the token type requested
*/
$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view   returns (uint256 balance);

}
```

EIP markdown below:
<eip>
/**
        @notice Get the balance of an account's tokens.
        @param _owner  The address of the token holder
        @param _id     ID of the token
        @return        The _owner's balance of the token type requested
     */
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) external view returns (uint256);

    /**
        @notice Get the balance of multiple account/token pairs
        @param _owners The addresses of the token holders
        @param _ids    ID of the tokens
        @return        The _owner's balance of the token types requested (i.e. balance for each (owner, id) pair)
     */
    function balanceOfBatch(address[] calldata _owners, uint256[] calldata _ids) external view returns (uint256[] memory);

    /**
        @notice Enable or disable approval for a third party ("operator") to manage all of the caller's tokens.
        @dev MUST emit the ApprovalForAll event on success.
        @param _operator  Address to add to the set of authorized operators
        @param _approved  True if the operator is approved, false to revoke approval
    */
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

    /**
        @notice Queries the approval status of an operator for a given owner.
        @param _owner     The owner of the tokens
        @param _operator  Address of authorized operator
        @return           True if the operator is approved, false if not
    */
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool);
</eip>

**Examples:**

Here are examples of similar ERC formal specifications:
Example ERC ERC721 specification:

    function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns (address owner);

    /// @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[tokenId] != address(0)
    /// @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[tokenId] == approved
    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address approved);

    /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

    /// @notice  postcondition  _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;
    
    /// @notice  postcondition ( ( _ownedTokensCount[_from] ==  __verifier_old_uint (_ownedTokensCount[_from] ) - 1  &&  _from  != _to ) || ( _from == _to )  )

    /// @notice  postcondition  _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == to
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /// @notice  postcondition ( ( _ownedTokensCount[_from] ==  __verifier_old_uint (_ownedTokensCount[_from] ) - 1  &&  _from  != _to ) || ( _from == _to )  )

    /// @notice  postcondition  _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}

```


=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-30 10:54:14] ===
Here is the annotated function with the appropriate postconditions added:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {
// Mapping from token ID to account balances
mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

// Mapping from account to operator approvals
mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

/**
    @notice Get the balance of an account's tokens.
    @param _owner  The address of the token holder
    @param _id     ID of the token
    @return        The _owner's balance of the token type requested
*/
/// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_id][_owner]
function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

}
```

### Explanation of Postcondition:
- The postcondition `balance == _balances[_id][_owner]` ensures that the returned balance from the `balanceOf` function matches the stored balance in the `_balances` mapping for the given token ID and owner address. This directly relates the return value to the state variable as required.
