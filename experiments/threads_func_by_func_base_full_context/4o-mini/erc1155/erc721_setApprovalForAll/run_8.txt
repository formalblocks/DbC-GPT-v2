=== USER [2025-05-30 10:57:16] ===
Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.

Your task is to annotate the function in the contract below:


```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {
// Mapping from token ID to account balances
mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

// Mapping from account to operator approvals
mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

/**
    @notice Enable or disable approval for a third party ("operator") to manage all of the caller's tokens.
    @dev MUST emit the ApprovalForAll event on success.
    @param _operator  Address to add to the set of authorized operators
    @param _approved  True if the operator is approved, false to revoke approval
*/

$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) public;
}
```

EIP markdown below:
<eip>
/**
        @notice Enable or disable approval for a third party ("operator") to manage all of the caller's tokens.
        @dev MUST emit the ApprovalForAll event on success.
        @param _operator  Address to add to the set of authorized operators
        @param _approved  True if the operator is approved, false to revoke approval
    */
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

    /**
        @notice Queries the approval status of an operator for a given owner.
        @param _owner     The owner of the tokens
        @param _operator  Address of authorized operator
        @return           True if the operator is approved, false if not
    */
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool);
</eip>

**Examples:**

Here are examples of similar ERC formal specifications:
Example ERC ERC721 specification:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.9.0;

/**

contract ERC721 {
    
    /// @notice postcondition _ownedTokensCount[_owner] == balance
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);
    
    /// @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _owner
    /// @notice postcondition  _owner !=  address(0)
    function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns (address owner);

    /// @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == _approved 
    function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external;
    
    /// @notice postcondition _tokenOwner[tokenId] != address(0)
    /// @notice postcondition _tokenApprovals[tokenId] == approved
    function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (address approved);

    /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;
    
    /// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator] == approved
    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool);

    /// @notice  postcondition ( ( _ownedTokensCount[_from] ==  __verifier_old_uint (_ownedTokensCount[_from] ) - 1  &&  _from  != _to ) || ( _from == _to )  ) 
    /// @notice  postcondition ( ( _ownedTokensCount[_to] ==  __verifier_old_uint ( _owned_kensCount[to] ) + 1  &&  _from  != _to ) || ( _from  == _to ) )
    /// @notice  postcondition  _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;
    
    /// @notice  postcondition ( ( _ownedTokensCount[_from] ==  __verifier_old_uint (_ownedTokensCount[_from] ) - 1  &&  _from  != _to ) || ( _from == _to )  ) 
    /// @notice  postcondition ( ( _ownedTokensCount[_to] ==  __verifier_old_uint ( _ownedTokensCount[_to] ) + 1  &&  _from  != _to ) || ( _from  == _to ) )
    /// @notice  postcondition  _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == to
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId) external;

    /// @notice  postcondition ( ( _ownedTokensCount[_from] ==  __verifier_old_uint (_ownedTokensCount[_from] ) - 1  &&  _from  != _to ) || ( _from == _to )  ) 
    /// @notice  postcondition ( ( _ownedTokensCount[_to] ==  __verifier_old_uint ( _ownedTokensCount[_to] ) + 1  &&  _from  != _to ) || ( _from  == _to ) )
    /// @notice  postcondition  _tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to
    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes calldata _data) external;
}

```

Here is the annotated function with the appropriate postconditions added:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {
// Mapping from token ID to account balances
mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

// Mapping from account to operator approvals
mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

/**
    @notice Enable or disable approval for a third party ("operator") to manage all of the caller's tokens.
    @dev MUST emit the ApprovalForAll event on success.
    @param _operator  Address to add to the set of authorized operators
    @param _approved  True if the operator is approved, false to revoke approval
*/
    
/// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) public;
}
```

### Explanation of Postconditions:
- The postcondition `/// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved` ensures that after the execution of the `setApprovalForAll` function, the approval status for the operator by the caller (msg.sender) is set to the value of `_approved`. This directly reflects the expected behavior of the function as described in the EIP documentation.

            Verification failed for function `function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) public;`

            The verifier found the following errors:
            ```
            Warning: This is a pre-release compiler version, please do not use it in production.
spec.sol:22:5: Error: Function, variable, struct or modifier declaration expected.
    - The postcondition `/// @notice pos ...
    ^

            ```

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?

It seems that the issue arises from the placement of the postcondition comment. In Solidity, comments should be placed directly above the function signature without any extra whitespace or indentation. Hereâ€™s the corrected version:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {
// Mapping from token ID to account balances
mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

// Mapping from account to operator approvals
mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

/**
    @notice Enable or disable approval for a third party ("operator") to manage all of the caller's tokens.
    @dev MUST emit the ApprovalForAll event on success.
    @param _operator  Address to add to the set of authorized operators
    @param _approved  True if the operator is approved, false to revoke approval
*/
/// @notice postcondition _operatorApprovals[msg.sender][_operator] == _approved
function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) public;
}
```

### Key Changes:
- The postcondition comment is now placed directly above the function signature without any additional whitespace or indentation, which should resolve the verification error.
