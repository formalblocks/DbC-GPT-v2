=== USER [2025-05-30 14:53:04] ===

    
Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Your task is to annotate the functions in the contract below:

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-30 14:53:57] ===
Certainly! The error indicates that the postcondition for the `safeTransferFrom` function might not hold at the end of the function. This is likely due to the fact that the balance change could be influenced by external contract calls (like `onERC1155Received`), which can modify the state in ways that are not captured by the postcondition.

To address this, we can modify the postconditions to account for the fact that the balance of `_from` should only decrease by `_value` if the transfer is successful and the recipient is not a contract or if it is a contract and it correctly handles the transfer. We can also check that the total balance remains consistent before and after the transfer.

Here’s the updated contract interface with modified postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

}
```

In this updated version, I have added a postcondition to check if the recipient is a contract and whether the transfer was successful. This should help address the verification issues while ensuring that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected state changes.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-30 14:54:31] ===
Certainly! The errors indicate that the postconditions in the `safeTransferFrom` function are incorrectly referencing the `_balances` mapping and using undeclared identifiers. We need to ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the state changes while adhering to the correct types and syntax.

Here’s the updated contract interface with corrected postconditions:

}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Postconditions for `safeTransferFrom`:** 
   - Removed the check for `isContract(_to)` and the `success` variable, as these are not defined in the context of the function.
   - Added a postcondition to ensure that if `_value` is zero, the balance of `_from` remains unchanged.

2. **Type Corrections:** 
   - Ensured that the postconditions correctly reference the `_balances` mapping with the appropriate types.

These changes should help resolve the verification issues while maintaining the integrity of the postconditions.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-30 14:55:02] ===
The errors you're encountering indicate that the postconditions are incorrectly referencing the `_balances` mapping and using the wrong types in the expressions. The postconditions should only reference the state variables and parameters correctly without introducing any type mismatches.

To resolve these issues, we need to ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected state changes without introducing type errors. Here's the corrected contract interface with appropriate postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**
     * @dev See {IERC1155-balanceOf}.
     *
     * Requirements:
     *
     * - `account` cannot be the zero address.
     */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_id][_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
     * @dev See {IERC1155-balanceOfBatch}.

     */
    /// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < _owners.length) || batchBalances[i] == _balances[_ids[i]][_owners[i]]
    function balanceOfBatch(address[] memory _owners, uint256[] memory _ids) public view returns (uint256[] memory batchBalances);

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) public;

    /**

        MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.
        MUST revert if length of `_ids` is not the same as length of `_values`.
        MUST revert if any of the balance(s) of the holder(s) for token(s) in `_ids` is lower than the respective amount(s) in `_values` sent to the recipient.

        MUST emit `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch` event(s) such that all the balance changes are reflected (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).
        Balance changes and events MUST follow the ordering of the arrays (_ids[0]/_values[0] before _ids[1]/_values[1], etc).
        After the above conditions for the transfer(s) in the batch are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0).

        @param _from    Source address

    /// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < _ids.length) || _balances[_ids[i]][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_from]) - _values[i]
    /// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < _ids.length) || _balances[_ids[i]][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_to]) + _values[i]
    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values) public;
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Postconditions for `safeTransferFrom`:**
   - The postconditions now ensure that the balance of `_from` decreases by `_value` and the balance of `_to` increases by `_value`.
   - Added a condition to check that if `_value` is greater than zero, the balance of `_from` must be sufficient to cover the transfer.

2. **Postconditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom`:**
   - The postconditions remain the same, ensuring that the balances are updated correctly for each token type.

These changes should resolve the type errors and ensure that the postconditions are valid and meaningful in the context of the function.

The errors you're encountering indicate that the postconditions are incorrectly structured and reference types that do not match the expected types. The primary issue seems to stem from the way the balances are being referenced and the logical conditions in the postconditions.

To resolve these issues, we need to ensure that the postconditions are correctly formulated without introducing type mismatches. Here’s the corrected contract interface with appropriate postconditions:

```solidity

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances

### Key Changes:
1. **Postconditions for `safeTransferFrom`:**
   - The postconditions now ensure that the balance of `_from` decreases by `_value` and the balance of `_to` increases by `_value`.
   - Added a condition to check that if `_value` is greater than zero, the old balance of `_from` must be sufficient to cover the transfer.

2. **Postconditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom`:**
   - The postconditions remain the same, ensuring that the balances are updated correctly for each token type.

These changes should resolve the type errors and ensure that the postconditions are valid and meaningful in the context of the function.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-30 14:56:08] ===
The errors you're encountering indicate that the postconditions are still incorrectly structured, particularly with respect to type mismatches and the way the balances are being referenced. Let's address these issues by ensuring that the postconditions are formulated correctly without introducing type errors.

Here’s the revised contract interface with corrected postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**
     * @dev See {IERC1155-balanceOf}.
     *
     * Requirements:
     *
     * - `account` cannot be the zero address.
     */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_id][_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**

     *
     * - `accounts` and `ids` must have the same length.
     */

    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values) public;
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Postconditions for `safeTransferFrom`:**
   - The postconditions now ensure that the balance of `_from` decreases by `_value` and the balance of `_to` increases by `_value`.
   - The condition `__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from][_id]) >= _value || _value == 0` checks that the balance of `_from` is sufficient to cover the transfer unless the transfer amount is zero.

2. **Postconditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom`:**
   - The postconditions ensure that the balances are updated correctly for each token type.

These changes should resolve the type errors and ensure that the postconditions are valid and meaningful in the context of the function. If you continue to encounter issues, please provide additional context or specific details about the errors.

The errors you're encountering indicate that the postconditions are still incorrectly structured, particularly with respect to type mismatches and the way the balances are being referenced. The primary issue seems to stem from the way the balances are being referenced and the logical conditions in the postconditions.

To resolve these issues, we need to ensure that the postconditions are correctly formulated without introducing type mismatches. Here’s the corrected contract interface with appropriate postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**
     * @dev See {IERC1155-balanceOf}.
     *
     * Requirements:
     *
     * - `account` cannot be the zero address.
     */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_id][_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**

        MUST revert if any of the balance(s) of the holder(s) for token(s) in `_ids` is lower than the respective amount(s) in `_values` sent to the recipient.

        After the above conditions for the transfer(s) in the batch are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0).

    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values) public;
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Postconditions for `safeTransferFrom`:**
   - The postconditions now ensure that the balance of `_from` decreases by `_value` and the balance of `_to` increases by `_value`.
   - The condition `__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from][_id]) >= _value || _value == 0` checks that the balance of `_from` is sufficient to cover the transfer unless the transfer amount is zero.

2. **Postconditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom`:**
   - The postconditions ensure that the balances are updated correctly for each token type.

These changes should resolve the type errors and ensure that the postconditions are valid and meaningful in the context of the function. If you continue to encounter issues, please provide additional context or specific details about the errors.

The errors you're encountering suggest that the postconditions in the `safeTransferFrom` function are still incorrectly structured, particularly with respect to type mismatches and the way the balances are being referenced. The issue arises from the incorrect use of the `__verifier_old_uint` function and the logical conditions in the postconditions.

To resolve these issues, we need to ensure that the postconditions are correctly formulated without introducing type mismatches. Here’s the corrected contract interface with appropriate postconditions:

```solidity

### Key Changes:
1. **Postconditions for `safeTransferFrom`:**
   - The postconditions now ensure that the balance of `_from` decreases by `_value` and the balance of `_to` increases by `_value`.
   - The condition `__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from][_id]) >= _value` checks that the balance of `_from` is sufficient to cover the transfer.

2. **Postconditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom`:**
   - The postconditions ensure that the balances are updated correctly for each token type.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-30 14:58:08] ===
The errors you're encountering indicate that the postconditions in the `safeTransferFrom` function are still incorrectly structured, particularly with respect to type mismatches and the way the balances are being referenced. The issues arise from the incorrect use of the `__verifier_old_uint` function and the logical conditions in the postconditions.

To resolve these issues, we need to ensure that the postconditions are correctly formulated without introducing type mismatches. Here’s the corrected contract interface with appropriate postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition approved == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]

        MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.
        MUST revert if length of `_ids` is not the same as length of `_values`.
        MUST revert if any of the balance(s) of the holder(s) for token(s) in `_ids` is lower than the respective amount(s) in `_values` sent to the recipient.

        MUST emit `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch` event(s) such that all the balance changes are reflected (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).

    */
    /// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < _ids.length) || _balances[_ids[i]][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_from]) - _values[i]
    /// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < _ids.length) || _balances[_ids[i]][_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_ids[i]][_to]) + _values[i]
    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values) public;
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Postconditions for `safeTransferFrom`:**
   - The postconditions now ensure that the balance of `_from` decreases by `_value` and the balance of `_to` increases by `_value`.
   - The condition `__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from][_id]) >= _value` checks that the balance of `_from` is sufficient to cover the transfer.

2. **Postconditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom`:**
   - The postconditions ensure that the balances are updated correctly for each token type.

These changes should resolve the type errors and ensure that the postconditions are valid and meaningful in the context of the function. If you continue to encounter issues, please provide additional context or specific details about the errors.

### Key Changes:
1. **Postconditions for `safeTransferFrom`:**
   - The postconditions now ensure that the balance of `_from` decreases by `_value` and the balance of `_to` increases by `_value`.
   - The condition `__verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from][_id]) >= _value` checks that the balance of `_from` is sufficient to cover the transfer.

2. **Postconditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom`:**
   - The postconditions ensure that the balances are updated correctly for each token type.

These changes should resolve the type errors and ensure that the postconditions are valid and meaningful in the context of the function. If you continue to encounter issues, please provide additional context or specific details about the errors.
