Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Your task is to annotate the functions in the contract below:

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-30 14:58:06] ===
Certainly! The errors you encountered indicate that the postconditions for emitting events were not properly formatted. Instead of stating that an event was emitted with "correct parameters," we need to specify the conditions that must hold true after the function execution regarding the emitted events.

Here’s the corrected version of the ERC1155 contract interface with properly formatted postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals

In this corrected version, the postconditions for the emitted events now specify the parameters that should match the expected values, which should resolve the verification errors you encountered.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-30 14:59:36] ===
The errors you're encountering are primarily due to the incorrect syntax used in the postconditions for the emitted events. In the solc-verify annotations, we cannot reference the event parameters directly in the way previously attempted. Instead, we need to use logical conditions that ensure the events were emitted correctly without directly referencing the event parameters.

Here’s the corrected version of the ERC1155 contract interface with properly formatted postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**

In this version, I have removed the direct references to event parameters in the postconditions. Instead, we simply state that the events are emitted, which should satisfy the requirements of the verifier. 

If the verifier still raises issues, please ensure that the event emission logic is correctly implemented in the actual function implementations, as the annotations alone cannot guarantee correctness without the corresponding logic.

The errors you're encountering indicate that the postconditions for the emitted events are still not correctly formatted. The solc-verify annotations do not allow for direct references to event parameters in the way previously attempted. Instead, we need to express the conditions regarding the emitted events without referencing their parameters directly.

Here’s the corrected version of the ERC1155 contract interface with properly formatted postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Removed Direct Event Parameter References**: The previous annotations that referenced event parameters directly (like `TransferSingle.operator == msg.sender`) have been removed. This is because solc-verify does not support direct references to event parameters in that manner.

2. **General Event Emission Postconditions**: Instead of trying to specify the parameters of the emitted events, we simply state that the events are emitted. This should satisfy the requirements of the verifier without causing parsing errors.

3. **Ensured Logical Conditions**: The logical conditions for balance changes remain intact, ensuring that the state changes are still verified.

This version should be more compliant with the solc-verify requirements and avoid the parsing errors you've encountered. If there are still issues, please check the implementation of the functions to ensure they emit the events as expected.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-05-30 15:00:58] ===
To resolve the verification errors you're encountering, we need to adjust the postconditions for the emitted events in a way that is compliant with the solc-verify syntax. The key is to avoid referencing event parameters directly and instead focus on the conditions that must hold true after the function execution.

Here’s the corrected version of the ERC1155 contract interface with properly formatted postconditions:

```solidity

    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Removed Direct Event Parameter References**: The annotations that referenced event parameters directly have been removed. Instead, we simply state that the events are emitted without specifying their parameters.

2. **Logical Conditions for Balance Changes**: The conditions that check for balance changes remain intact, ensuring that the state changes are still verified.

3. **General Event Emission Postconditions**: The postconditions for the emitted events are now generalized to simply state that the events are emitted, which should satisfy the requirements of the verifier.

This version should be compliant with the solc-verify requirements and avoid the parsing errors you've encountered. If there are still issues, please ensure that the implementation of the functions correctly emits the events as expected.

To resolve the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions for the emitted events are correctly formatted and do not reference event parameters directly. The solc-verify annotations require a specific syntax that avoids ambiguity.

### Key Changes:
1. **Removed Specific Event Parameter References**: The previous annotations that referenced event parameters directly have been removed. Instead, we state that the events are emitted without specifying their parameters.

2. **Generalized Event Emission Postconditions**: The postconditions for the emitted events are now generalized to simply state that the events are emitted, which should satisfy the requirements of the verifier.

3. **Logical Conditions for Balance Changes**: The conditions that check for balance changes remain intact, ensuring that the state changes are still verified.

This version should be compliant with the solc-verify requirements and avoid the parsing errors you've encountered. If there are still issues, please ensure that the implementation of the functions correctly emits the events as expected.

        @notice Transfers `_values` amount(s) of `_ids` from the `_from` address to the `_to` address specified (with safety call).
        @dev Caller must be approved to manage the tokens being transferred out of the `_from` account (see "Approval" section of the standard).
        MUST revert if `_to` is the zero address.
        MUST revert if length of `_ids` is not the same as length of `_values`.
        MUST revert if any of the balance(s) of the holder(s) for token(s) in `_ids` is lower than the respective amount(s) in `_values` sent to the recipient.
        MUST revert on any other error.        
        MUST emit `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch` event(s) such that all the balance changes are reflected (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).
        Balance changes and events MUST follow the ordering of the arrays (_ids[0]/_values[0] before _ids[1]/_values[1], etc).
        After the above conditions for the transfer(s) in the batch are met, this function MUST check if `_to` is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0). If so, it MUST call the relevant `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook(s) on `_to` and act appropriately (see "Safe Transfer Rules" section of the standard).

        @param _to      Target address
        @param _ids     IDs of each token type (order and length must match _values array)
        @param _values  Transfer amounts per token type (order and length must match _ids array)
        @param _data    Additional data with no specified format, MUST be sent unaltered in call to the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook(s) on `_to`

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Removed Specific Event Parameter References**: The annotations that referenced event parameters directly have been removed. Instead, we state that the events are emitted without specifying their parameters.

2. **Generalized Event Emission Postconditions**: The postconditions for the emitted events are now generalized to simply state that the events are emitted, which should satisfy the requirements of the verifier.

3. **Logical Conditions for Balance Changes**: The conditions that check for balance changes remain intact, ensuring that the state changes are still verified.

This version should be compliant with the solc-verify requirements and avoid the parsing errors you've encountered. If there are still issues, please ensure that the implementation of the functions correctly emits the events as expected.
