=== USER [2025-05-30 02:18:44] ===

    
Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.


Your task is to annotate the functions in the contract below:

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Removed the `if` conditions at the end of the quantified expressions in the `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` functions**: These conditions were causing syntax issues within the solc-verify annotations. Instead, the assumption is that the `_value` should be greater than 0 to proceed with the state changes when `_to` is not the zero address. 

2. **Clarified Postconditions**: Ensured that the postconditions clearly state what happens in the case of transfers, while emphasizing that they only occur when `_to` is not the zero address.

Please review the changes and reattempt verification.

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Removed Conditional Statements from Postconditions**: I have removed any previous conditional checks from the state variable modification postconditions. The handler now considers that if state changes are eligible, they will happen automatically with the assumption based on the constraints outlined in the method description.
   
2. **Simplified Postconditions**: For both `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`, the simplification clarifies that whenever the corresponding balances are adjusted, it would be noted without unnecessary conditions.

3. **Ensured Correct Syntax for Postconditions**: The updated postconditions follow the solc-verify syntax expected by the verification tool.

Please verify the updated specification.

### Key Fixes:

1. **Adjusted Conditions in the `safeTransferFrom` Postcondition**: 
   - The postcondition for `_balances[_id][_from]` is now conditioned only upon `_to` being non-zero. 
   - The previous postconditions implied that `_value` would always be reduced without ensuring it could be, leading to potential false conditions when not enough tokens are available for the transfer. 
   - This was restructured to align the transfers correctly with the correct expectations regarding the function's operations.

2. **Consistent Formatting**: I made sure other postconditions remain consistent across both functions while strictly following the defined conditions. This prevents the error about conditions that might not hold true due to state changes being dependent on the remaining balance.

This version should align with the requirements for verification successfully. Please reattempt verification with this updated specification.

### Key Fixes:
1. **Postconditions Modified to Ensure Measurements Hold**:
   - I have added **`&& _value > 0`** to the condition checks in the `safeTransferFrom` function's postconditions to ensure that these balance changes are only applied if the `_value` is non-zero (because attempting to transfer zero tokens doesn’t change balances).
   - Similarly, for `safeBatchTransferFrom`, it states the conditions check that balances are only modified when the transfer originates from a valid non-zero address while relying on conditions.

2. **Fixed the Syntax Errors**:
   - Removed previous syntax that resulted in "Expected end of expression but got 'if'" errors due to trying to evaluate contingent statements within conditions where they weren’t syntactically valid. Now stripped statements properly format expected condition outcomes.

These fixes should satisfy the conditions for successful verification based on your last run through the system. Please verify with these changes.

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Removed Conditional Statements from Postconditions**: To address the verification errors related to the expected end of expressions, I have removed the `if` conditions from the postconditions in `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`.
2. **Structured Properly for Verification**: The focus is now solely on checking the expected state changes based on the assumptions given by the function's operations without additional `if` conditions causing syntax issues.
3. **Simplified Postconditions**: The postconditions are now straightforward and reflect the required state of balances post-transfer without introducing invalid expressions.

This should resolve the previous issues encountered during verification. Please attempt the verification process with this update.

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Updated `if` Statements to `||` Conditions**:
   - The expressions that previously had `if` statements have been replaced with logical OR (`||`) conditions. This change ensures compliance with the solc-verify syntax while accounting for cases when transferring to the zero address.
   - For instance, `_balances[_id][_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_id][_from]) - _value || (_to == address(0) && _value > 0)` accounts for the condition where the address is zero while also ensuring no invalid state changes happen if attempting a transfer to the zero address with a value.

2. **Ensured Consistency in Both Functions**:
   - Applied similar transformations for consistent logic in both `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` methods.

These adjustments aim to address the verification errors directly while clarifying the logical flow and maintaining the contract's integrity. Please attempt verification using this updated specification.

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Added Conditions for Transfers to Zero Address**:
   - In the postconditions of `safeTransferFrom`, additional checks were added to ensure the state of balances is accounted for when the transfer is attempted to a zero address, even if the amount is non-zero. This prevents false conditions during verification, as balances cannot change if `_to` is the zero address.
   - Similar adjustments were applied to `safeBatchTransferFrom` to establish balanced checks when transferring tokens to the zero address.

2. **Ensured Correct Verification-Based Logic**:
   - This version of the contract should avoid postconditions that might not hold at the end of the `safeTransferFrom` function while providing robust checks entirely focused on the outputs that occur within the conditions defined.

The modifications provided should improve the overall alignment with the expected verification criteria. Please attempt verification again using this specification.

### Key Changes:
1. **Addressed Postcondition Issues**:
   - The postconditions now clearly indicate that they hold when transferring to a zero address as needed for verification consistency.
   - By incorporating both existing conditions and checks for zero addresses where balances don’t change, the integrity of state changes throughout the function is ensured while eliminating false conditions.

2. **Retained Clear Logical Flow**:
   - Each conditional statement directly correlates comprehensibly to logical function outcomes while ensuring alignment with each defined operation.

These improvements are tailored to address the concerns and ensure compliance with expected verification behavior. Please test this new code to see if the verification passes successfully.
