=== USER [2025-05-30 02:02:51] ===

    
Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.


Your task is to annotate the functions in the contract below:

### Explanation of Changes:
1. The postcondition for `safeTransferFrom` has been simplified to ensure it checks for the case in which the `_to` address is `address(0)` separately, making the conditions clearer and ensuring they hold.
2. The same structure is applied to the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function's postcondition, ensuring that the condition clearly reflects balance changes without introducing ambiguity. 

This adjustment ensures that the state invariants are reliably met regardless of the conditions during the function execution.

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Adjustment in `safeTransferFrom` Postcondition**:
   - The condition on `_from` allows success when _to is zero (i.e., burning tokens), and also ensures that if it transfers to a non-zero address, the balances must reflect the expected changes. This covers cases where the balance remains unchanged.
   - Adapted to ensure correctness as per the ERC-1155 standard while maintaining clarity.

2. **Adjustment in `safeBatchTransferFrom` Postcondition**:
   - The postcondition ensures that if tokens are transferred to a non-zero address, the appropriate balance updates are conducted. Conversely, for token burn scenarios (when `_to` is address(0)), it adjusts the balance of the `_from`. 
   
This comprehensive check helps ensure that all edge cases are handled, as per ERC-1155 token transfer rules, and maintains compliance with the state conditions required.

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Adjustment of Transfer Conditions**: 
   - In both the `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` functions, conditions relating to the state of `_from` and `_to` balances have been refined. The redundant checks have been removed to ensure clarity and correctness.
  
2. **Handling Zero Address Transfers**:
   - When transferring to the zero address (indicating burning), the postconditions now only state that the balance of `_from` should decrease.
  
3. **Consistency in Change Tracking**:
   - For transfers to non-zero addresses, the conditions now ensure both the balance of the sender reduces while the receiver’s balance increases, effectively maintaining the correct state.

These changes are aimed at ensuring that the expectations are correctly tracked post-execution, per the token standard's requirements.

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Postcondition Simplification**:
   - For `safeTransferFrom`, the conditions have been carefully restructured. It now clearly differentiates between transferring to a non-zero address and burning (transferring to zero), ensuring that balance updates correctly reflect either the withdrawal or deposit of tokens.
   - The check for the balance of `_from` when `_to` is address zero is kept separate to ensure correctness in cases of burning tokens.

2. **Batch Transfer Logic**: 
   - Similarly, for `safeBatchTransferFrom`, the postconditions are expressed to provide clear tracking of balances for each token in the batch. Each condition distinctly confirms the expected state after a transfer, mirroring the logic implemented for single transfers, which justifies its correctness.

These modifications help ensure that the verifier's requirements are satisfied by clearly articulating the expected state changes without ambiguity, thus fostering a straightforward verification process.

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Clarified Postcondition for `safeTransferFrom`**:
   - The postcondition was streamlined to avoid ambiguities. The expressions focusing on the balance updates for both the sender and receiver are clearly defined. 
   - The condition ensures that either a transfer to another address is done correctly or for burning tokens when `_to` is zero, clearly delineating the two scenarios.

2. **Retained Similar Format for `safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - The batch transfer logic is similarly articulated to reflect the expected state changes. Both the success of the transfer to a non-zero address and the handling of burns (transfers to zero) are clearly delineated.
   
These fixes enhance the logic in line with the requirements posed by the ERC-1155 specifications while addressing possible verification issues by establishing the expected state changes confidently.

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Removal of Redundant Conditions**:
   - The postcondition in `safeTransferFrom` has been made clearer. If the `_to` address is not the zero address, it checks that both the sender's and recipient's balances are updated appropriately. If sending to the zero address, it confirms only that the sender's balance decreases.
   - This structure aligns with the requirements of the ERC-1155 transfer semantics while removing any confusion about balance tracking during burning.

2. **Consistency with Batch Transfers**:
   - The same logical approach is echoed in the batch transfer method, maintaining clear definitions of expectations for each token transfer's effect on balances. Each conditional statement reflects the expected changes accurately.

The modifications aim to ensure that the conditions verify correctly according to expected state transitions, rectifying prior issues encountered during verification.

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Adjusted Postcondition for `safeTransferFrom`**:
   - The previous error indicated that the conditions might not hold as expected. The provided logic has been simplified for clarity while retaining the necessary checks. The structure accommodates both transferring to a non-zero address and burning tokens, but the focus around the general balance updates is ensured to align cleaner with the expectations.
  
2. **Defensive Conditions**:
   - The postcondition logic now confirms that both the sender and recipient’s balances are updated as expected without complicating conditions. This aligns proof requirements with transfer semantics without unnecessary checks that could lead to confusion in verification.
  
3. **Batch Transfer Logic Remains Intact**:
   - The batch transfer has been kept consistent in maintaining its conditions. The complexity inline with the specified balance updates as tokens are transferred reflects its behavior within the function expected state.

Overall, these adjustments focus on the core intent behind ERC-1155 transfer semantics while ensuring the verifier’s requirements are more likely to be satisfied.
