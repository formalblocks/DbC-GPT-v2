=== USER [2025-05-30 02:28:53] ===

    
Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.


Your task is to annotate the functions in the contract below:

Certainly! The issue with the postcondition for the `safeTransferFrom` function arises because it assumes that the balance changes will always occur, which may not be the case if the transfer is not successful (e.g., if the `_to` address is a contract that does not accept the transfer). 

To address this, we need to modify the postcondition to account for the possibility that the transfer may not occur. We can do this by ensuring that the postcondition only applies when the transfer is successful. Here’s the updated interface with corrected postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json

    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values) public;
}
```

In the updated postcondition for `safeTransferFrom`, I added a check to ensure that if the `_value` is greater than zero and `_to` is not the zero address, then the balance changes must occur. Otherwise, the balances remain unchanged. This should satisfy the verifier's requirements.

### Changes Made:
1. **Fixed Postcondition Syntax**: The postcondition for `safeTransferFrom` has been updated to ensure it correctly checks the balance changes only when the transfer is successful.
2. **Removed Redundant Postcondition**: The second postcondition for `safeTransferFrom` was removed as it was incorrectly structured and redundant.

This should resolve the parsing errors and ensure that the postconditions are valid for the verifier.

### Key Corrections:
1. **Postcondition for `safeTransferFrom`**: The postcondition has been revised to ensure that it checks for balance changes only when the transfer is valid. The second postcondition was removed as it was redundant and incorrectly structured.
2. **Ensured Clarity**: The postconditions are now clear and concise, ensuring that they can be parsed correctly by the verifier.

This should resolve the parsing errors and ensure that the postconditions are valid for the verifier. If there are still issues, please provide specific feedback on the errors encountered.

The errors indicate that the postconditions for the `safeTransferFrom` function are not correctly capturing the possible states after the function execution. Specifically, the postconditions need to account for the fact that the transfer may not happen under certain conditions, such as if the `_to` address is a contract that does not accept the transfer.

To address this, we can modify the postconditions to ensure they reflect the correct state changes only when the transfer is successful. Here’s the updated interface with revised postconditions:

### Key Corrections:
1. **Postcondition for `safeTransferFrom`**: The postcondition has been revised to ensure that it checks for balance changes only when the transfer is valid. The condition now states that if `_to` is the zero address or `_value` is zero, the balances remain unchanged. Otherwise, it checks the expected balance changes.
2. **Removed Redundant Conditions**: The previous conditions that were causing the verifier to fail have been simplified to focus on the essential checks.

This should resolve the verification issues and ensure that the postconditions are valid for the verifier. If there are still issues, please provide specific feedback on the errors encountered.

### Key Corrections:
1. **Postcondition for `safeTransferFrom`**: The postcondition has been revised to ensure that it checks for balance changes only when the transfer is valid. The condition now states that if `_to` is the zero address or `_value` is zero, the balances remain unchanged. Otherwise, it checks the expected balance changes.
2. **Ensured Clarity**: The postconditions are now clear and concise, ensuring that they can be parsed correctly by the verifier.

This should resolve the verification issues and ensure that the postconditions are valid for the verifier. If there are still issues, please provide specific feedback on the errors encountered.

The verification errors indicate that the postconditions for the `safeTransferFrom` function are still not correctly capturing the possible states after the function execution. Specifically, the postconditions must account for the fact that the transfer may not occur under certain conditions, such as if the `_to` address is a contract that does not accept the transfer.

To address this, we can simplify the postconditions to ensure they reflect the correct state changes only when the transfer is successful. Here’s the updated interface with revised postconditions:

To address this, we need to ensure that the postcondition accounts for scenarios where the transfer does not happen, such as when the `_to` address is a contract that does not accept the transfer or when the `_value` is zero. 

Here’s the updated interface with revised postconditions that should resolve the verification issues:

```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC1155 {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 id, uint256 value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed operator, address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256[] ids, uint256[] values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed account, address indexed operator, bool approved);
    event URI(string value, uint256 indexed id);

    // Mapping from token ID to account balances
    mapping (uint256 => mapping(address => uint256)) private _balances;

    // Mapping from account to operator approvals
    mapping (address => mapping(address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    // Used as the URI for all token types by relying on ID substitution, e.g. https://token-cdn-domain/{id}.json
    string private _uri;

    /**

### Key Corrections:
1. **Postcondition for `safeTransferFrom`**: The postcondition has been revised to ensure that it checks for balance changes only when the transfer is valid. The condition now states that if `_to` is the zero address or `_value` is zero, the balances remain unchanged. Otherwise, it checks the expected balance changes.
2. **Ensured Clarity**: The postconditions are now clear and concise, ensuring that they can be parsed correctly by the verifier.

This should resolve the verification issues and ensure that the postconditions are valid for the verifier. If there are still issues, please provide specific feedback on the errors encountered.

The verification errors indicate that the postcondition for the `safeTransferFrom` function is still not correctly capturing the possible states after the function execution. The current postcondition assumes that the transfer will always succeed if `_to` is not the zero address and `_value` is greater than zero, which may not be the case if the `_to` address is a contract that does not accept the transfer.

To resolve this, we need to ensure that the postcondition reflects the expected state changes only when the transfer is successful. Here’s the updated interface with revised postconditions that should resolve the verification issues:
