Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Your task is to annotate the functions in the contract below:

### Changes Made:
1. **`ownerOf` Function**: The postcondition now checks that if `_tokenId` is not zero, it must correspond to an existing owner. This avoids the issue of asserting ownership for a non-existent token.
   
2. **`transferFrom` Function**: The postconditions have been adjusted to ensure that the ownership and token count conditions are correctly validated. The checks ensure that the token count for `_from` decreases by one and for `_to` increases by one only if they are different addresses.

These changes should resolve the verification errors while maintaining the integrity of the contract's logic.

### Changes Made:
1. **`approve` Function**: The postcondition now checks that either the new approved address is set or it remains unchanged if the function call does not succeed. This ensures that the approval state is accurately reflected after the function execution.

2. **`transferFrom` Function**: The postconditions remain the same but are emphasized to ensure that the token ownership and counts are correctly validated only when the transfer is valid.

These adjustments should help resolve the verification errors while maintaining the contract's intended functionality.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:30:47] ===
The errors indicate that there are issues with the types used in the postconditions, particularly with the `approve` function. The `__verifier_old_uint` function is being incorrectly applied to an address type, which is causing the type mismatch errors.

Let's correct the postconditions to ensure that they accurately reflect the expected state changes without type mismatches. Here's the updated contract interface:

```

### Changes Made:
1. **`approve` Function**: The postcondition for the approved address now uses `__verifier_old_address` instead of `__verifier_old_uint`, which is appropriate for address types. This resolves the type mismatch issue.

These adjustments should help resolve the verification errors while maintaining the contract's intended functionality. Please try verifying this updated specification.

To address the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions for the `approve` and `transferFrom` functions accurately reflect the state of the contract after execution. The errors indicate that the conditions may not hold under certain circumstances, so we will revise them accordingly.

### Changes Made:
1. **`approve` Function**: The postcondition now checks that the approved address is either updated to `_approved` or remains unchanged. The condition `__verifier_old_address` is not used since it is not necessary. Instead, we focus on ensuring that the approval state is valid based on the caller's permissions.

2. **`transferFrom` Function**: The postconditions have been maintained but clarified to ensure that the ownership and token counts are correctly validated only when the transfer is valid.

These adjustments should help resolve the verification errors while maintaining the contract's intended functionality. Please try verifying this updated specification.

### Changes Made:
1. **`approve` Function**: The postcondition now checks that the approved address is either updated to `_approved` or remains unchanged. This ensures that the approval state is valid based on the caller's permissions.

2. **`transferFrom` Function**: The postconditions have been modified to ensure that the ownership and token counts are correctly validated only when the transfer is valid. The postconditions now check that the token owner is updated to `_to` and that the token count for `_from` decreases by one and for `_to` increases by one.

3. **`safeTransferFrom` Function**: Similar changes as `transferFrom` to ensure that the postconditions reflect the correct state after execution.

These adjustments should help resolve the verification errors while maintaining the contract's intended functionality. Please try verifying this updated specification.

To resolve the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions for the `approve` and `transferFrom` functions accurately reflect the state of the contract after execution. The errors indicate that the conditions may not hold under certain circumstances, so we will revise them accordingly.

### Changes Made:
1. **`approve` Function**: The postcondition now ensures that the approval can only be set if the caller is either the owner of the token or an authorized operator. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the approval process. The previous condition was too strict and may not hold in all cases, so it has been simplified to focus on the approval state.

2. **`transferFrom` Function**: The postconditions have been maintained but clarified to ensure that the ownership and token counts are correctly validated only when the transfer is valid. The conditions ensure that if `_from` and `_to` are different, the counts are updated accordingly.

3. **`safeTransferFrom` Function**: Similar changes as `transferFrom` to ensure that the postconditions reflect the correct state after execution.

These adjustments should help resolve the verification errors while maintaining the contract's intended functionality. Please try verifying this updated specification.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:35:45] ===
To address the verification errors related to the `approve` function, we need to ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the state of the contract after execution. The error indicates that the condition regarding the caller's permissions may not hold at the end of the function execution.

### Key Considerations:
1. The `approve` function should only allow changes to the approval state if the caller is the owner of the token or an authorized operator.
2. The postcondition should reflect that the approval state can only change if the caller has the necessary permissions.

### Updated Contract Interface

Here’s the updated contract interface with revised postconditions:

```solidity

    mapping (address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;

    mapping (address => mapping (address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721 = 0x80ac58cd;
