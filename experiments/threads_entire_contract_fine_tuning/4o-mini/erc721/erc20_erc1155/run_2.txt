Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Your task is to annotate the functions in the contract below:

### Changes Made:
1. **`ownerOf` Function**: Updated the postcondition to check that if `_tokenId` is not zero, then the owner must be the address stored in `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]`.
2. **`transferFrom` Function**: Removed the postcondition that directly checks `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` against `_from` after the transfer, as it may not hold if the transfer is successful. Instead, it now checks that `_to` is not the zero address and updates the owned token counts correctly.

These changes should resolve the verification errors while maintaining the integrity of the contract's specifications.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:07:14] ===
To address the verification errors, we need to refine the postconditions for the `transferFrom` function. The errors indicate that the postconditions regarding the ownership of the token and the owned token count may not hold true after the function execution, especially if the transfer is successful.

### Updated Postconditions
1. **Ownership Check**: We cannot assert that `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` equals `_from` after the transfer since it will change to `_to`. Instead, we should ensure that the token is no longer owned by `_from` and is now owned by `_to`.
2. **Token Count Check**: We need to ensure that the owned token count for `_from` decreases by one only if `_from` is not equal to `_to`.

### Changes Made:
1. **`transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` Functions**:
   - Updated the postcondition for ownership to assert that `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` is now `_to`.
   - Adjusted the postcondition for the owned token count to only decrease for `_from` if `_from` is not equal to `_to`. This ensures that if the sender and receiver are the same, the count does not change.

These adjustments should help ensure that the postconditions are valid and hold true after the function execution, addressing the verification errors.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:08:13] ===
To resolve the verification error related to the `transferFrom` function, we need to ensure that the postcondition regarding the `_ownedTokensCount[_to]` accurately reflects the state after the transfer. The error indicates that the postcondition `_ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) + 1` might not hold, particularly if `_to` was previously the zero address or if the transfer is invalid.

### Updated Postconditions
1. **Token Count for `_to`**: We should only assert that `_ownedTokensCount[_to]` increases by one if `_to` is not the zero address. If `_to` is the zero address, the count should not change.
2. **Token Count for `_from`**: We should ensure that the count for `_from` decreases by one only if `_from` is not equal to `_to`.

Here’s the revised contract interface with the updated postconditions:

These adjustments should ensure that the postconditions are valid and hold true after the function execution, addressing the verification errors.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:09:04] ===
To resolve the verification error regarding the postcondition for the `transferFrom` function, we need to ensure that the conditions accurately reflect the state of the contract after the transfer operation. The error indicates that the postcondition `_ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) + 1` might not hold true, particularly if `_to` was previously the zero address or if the transfer is invalid.

### Updated Postconditions
1. **Token Count for `_to`**: We should not assert that `_ownedTokensCount[_to]` increases by one if `_to` was previously the zero address, as this would be invalid. Instead, we can assert that if `_to` is not the zero address, then it must have increased by one.
2. **Token Count for `_from`**: We should ensure that the count for `_from` decreases by one only if `_from` is not equal to `_to`.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:09:42] ===
The verification errors indicate that the postconditions using the implication operator (`==>`) are not valid in the solc-verify annotations. We need to adjust the postconditions to avoid using the implication operator and instead use logical constructs that are acceptable in the solc-verify syntax.

### Updated Postconditions
1. **Token Count for `_to`**: Instead of using the implication operator, we can express the condition in a way that checks if `_to` is not the zero address and then asserts the increase in the count.
2. **Token Count for `_from`**: We should ensure that the count for `_from` decreases by one only if `_from` is not equal to `_to`.

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed Implication Operator**: The implication operator (`==>`) has been removed from the postconditions. Instead, we now directly check the conditions using logical constructs that are valid in solc-verify.
2. **Postconditions**: The postconditions for `_ownedTokensCount[_to]` now check that if `_to` is not the zero address, then it must have increased by one.

These adjustments should ensure that the postconditions are valid and hold true after the function execution, addressing the verification errors.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:10:32] ===
To resolve the verification error regarding the postcondition for the `transferFrom` function, we need to ensure that the conditions accurately reflect the state of the contract after the transfer operation. The error indicates that the postcondition `_ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) + 1` might not hold true, particularly if `_to` was previously the zero address or if the transfer is invalid.

### Updated Postconditions
1. **Token Count for `_to`**: We need to ensure that we only assert that `_ownedTokensCount[_to]` increases by one if `_to` is not the zero address and was not previously the zero address.
2. **Token Count for `_from`**: We should ensure that the count for `_from` decreases by one only if `_from` is not equal to `_to`.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:12:07] ===
The verification errors indicate that the use of the implication operator (`=>`) in the postconditions is not valid in the solc-verify annotations. We need to adjust the postconditions to avoid using this operator and instead express the conditions in a way that is acceptable in solc-verify syntax.

### Updated Postconditions
1. **Token Count for `_to`**: We will check if `_to` is not the zero address and then assert that the count has increased by one. We will use a logical OR to ensure that the condition holds true regardless of whether `_to` is the zero address.
2. **Token Count for `_from`**: We will ensure that the count for `_from` decreases by one only if `_from` is not equal to `_to`.

Here’s the revised contract interface with the corrected postconditions:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:13:05] ===
To resolve the verification error regarding the postcondition for the `transferFrom` function, we need to ensure that the conditions accurately reflect the state of the contract after the transfer operation. The error indicates that the postcondition `_to == address(0) || _ownedTokensCount[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_to]) + 1` might not hold true, particularly if `_to` was previously the zero address or if the transfer is invalid.

### Updated Postconditions
1. **Token Count for `_to`**: We need to ensure that we only assert that `_ownedTokensCount[_to]` increases by one if `_to` is not the zero address. If `_to` is the zero address, we should not assert any change in `_ownedTokensCount[_to]`.
2. **Token Count for `_from`**: We should ensure that the count for `_from` decreases by one only if `_from` is not equal to `_to`.
