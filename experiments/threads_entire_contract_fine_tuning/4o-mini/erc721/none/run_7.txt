=== USER [2025-06-08 21:50:15] ===

    
Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Your task is to annotate the functions in the contract below:

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:50:53] ===
Certainly! The error indicates that the postcondition for the `isApprovedForAll` function references an undeclared variable `isApproved`. Instead, we should directly relate the return value of the function to the state variable. 

Here's the corrected interface with the appropriate postconditions:

In this corrected version, the postcondition for `isApprovedForAll` has been modified to directly reflect the return value without using an undeclared variable. The postcondition now asserts that the return value `approved` corresponds to the state variable `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:53:05] ===
The errors indicate that some postconditions may not hold under certain circumstances. Specifically, the postcondition for `balanceOf` stating that `balance >= 0` is always true since balances cannot be negative. However, the postcondition for `transferFrom` regarding the `_ownedTokensCount` may not hold if the transfer is not valid (e.g., if `_from` is not the owner of the token).

To address these issues, we need to revise the postconditions to ensure they accurately reflect the expected behavior of the functions. Here’s the updated interface with the corrected postconditions:

### Changes Made:
1. **Balance Postcondition**: The postcondition for `balanceOf` remains unchanged since it is inherently true that the balance cannot be negative.
2. **Transfer Postconditions**: The postconditions for `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` have been modified to account for the possibility that the transfer may not occur (e.g., if the caller is not the owner or if the transfer fails). The postconditions now check if the `msg.sender` is the owner or the recipient to adjust the count accordingly.

These adjustments should help ensure that the postconditions hold true under all valid execution paths, addressing the verification errors.

The verification errors indicate that the postconditions for the `balanceOf` function and the `transferFrom` function may not hold under certain circumstances. 

1. **For `balanceOf`**: The postcondition `balance >= 0` is inherently true since the balance cannot be negative, but we need to ensure that the return value is correctly defined.
  
2. **For `transferFrom`**: The postconditions regarding `_ownedTokensCount` for both `_from` and `_to` may not hold if the transfer is invalid (e.g., if the caller is not the owner or if the transfer fails). We need to ensure that we only update the counts if the transfer is successful.

2. **Transfer Postconditions**: The postconditions for `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` have been revised to ensure they only apply when the transfer is valid. The conditions now specify that the counts will only change if the `msg.sender` is the owner or the recipient, making it clear that these changes are conditional on the validity of the transfer.

These adjustments should help ensure that the postconditions hold true under all valid execution paths, addressing the verification errors.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:56:43] ===
The verification errors indicate that the syntax used in the postconditions for the `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions is incorrect. Specifically, the use of "if" in the postconditions is not valid in the solc-verify syntax. Instead, we should use logical conditions to express the expected state changes.

Here’s the corrected interface with properly formatted postconditions:

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:57:53] ===
The verification error indicates that the postcondition for the `transferFrom` function regarding `_ownedTokensCount[_from]` might not hold at the end of the function. This suggests that the condition is not sufficient to guarantee that the count will be decremented correctly when the transfer is valid.

To address this, we need to ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected state changes, specifically that the counts for `_from` and `_to` are only updated when the transfer is valid. We can also simplify the postconditions to ensure they only apply when the transfer is successful.

Here’s the updated interface with revised postconditions:

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:58:42] ===
The verification error indicates that the postcondition for the `transferFrom` function regarding `_ownedTokensCount[_from]` might not hold at the end of the function. This suggests that the condition is not sufficient to guarantee that the count will be decremented correctly when the transfer is valid.

To address this, we need to ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected state changes, specifically that the counts for `_from` and `_to` are only updated when the transfer is valid. 

### Key Considerations:
1. **Transfer Validity**: The transfer can only occur if the `msg.sender` is the owner, an approved operator, or the approved address for the NFT. If the transfer fails, the counts should not change.
2. **Postconditions**: We should ensure that the postconditions clearly reflect the expected state changes only when the transfer is valid.

Here’s the updated interface with revised postconditions:
