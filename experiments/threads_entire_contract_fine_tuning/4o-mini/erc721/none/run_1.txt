=== USER [2025-06-08 21:01:52] ===

    
Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Your task is to annotate the functions in the contract below:

Certainly! The error indicates that the postcondition for the `isApprovedForAll` function was incorrectly referencing a variable `isApproved`, which is not declared in the function signature. Instead, we should directly reference the return value of the function.

Specifically, the expression `return == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]` is not valid syntax in the context of the solc-verify annotations.

In this corrected version, the postcondition for `isApprovedForAll` has been simplified to directly state that the return value is equal to the value in the `_operatorApprovals` mapping. This should resolve the verification errors. If you continue to encounter issues, please ensure that the context in which this contract is being compiled is correct and that there are no other conflicting annotations or issues in the surrounding code.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:06:33] ===
The errors indicate that some postconditions may not hold at the end of the functions due to the way they are specified. Let's address each of the problematic postconditions:

1. **For `balanceOf`:** The postcondition `balance >= 0` is always true because the balance is a count of tokens owned, which cannot be negative. However, we need to ensure that it reflects the actual state of the mapping `_ownedTokensCount[_owner]`.

2. **For `isApprovedForAll`:** The postcondition should simply state that the return value is equal to the mapping value without using a quantified variable.

3. **For `transferFrom`:** The postcondition `_ownedTokensCount[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_ownedTokensCount[_from]) - 1` might not hold if the `_from` address does not own any tokens. We need to ensure that the condition is only checked when `_from` is indeed the owner of the token.

Here’s the corrected version of the contract interface with the appropriate postconditions:

### Changes Made:
1. **`balanceOf` Postcondition:** Changed to `balance == _ownedTokensCount[_owner]` to ensure that the balance reflects the actual count of tokens owned.
  
2. **`isApprovedForAll` Postcondition:** Updated to `approved == _operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]` to directly relate the return value to the mapping without using a quantified variable.

3. **`transferFrom` Postconditions:** Kept the existing postconditions but ensure that the function logic guarantees that `_from` is the owner of the token before decrementing the count.

These changes should help ensure that the postconditions hold true at the end of their respective functions. If you still encounter issues, please provide additional context or details about the function implementations or the surrounding code.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:07:54] ===
The error indicates that the postcondition for the `transferFrom` function may not hold at the end of the function. This is likely because the function should only decrement the `_ownedTokensCount[_from]` if `_from` is indeed the owner of the token being transferred. If `_from` does not own the token, the postcondition would not hold.

To address this, we need to ensure that the postcondition checks that the `_from` address is the owner of the token before decrementing the count. We can also add a condition to ensure that the token is valid and that the transfer is occurring.

Here’s the corrected version of the contract interface with the appropriate postconditions:

These changes should ensure that the postconditions hold true at the end of their respective functions, addressing the verification errors. If you continue to encounter issues, please provide additional context or details about the function implementations or the surrounding code.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:08:39] ===
The error messages indicate that the syntax used in the postconditions for the `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions is incorrect. Specifically, the use of a conditional expression (like `1 if condition else 0`) is not valid in the context of solc-verify annotations.

To fix this, we can simplify the postconditions to ensure they accurately reflect the expected state changes without using conditional expressions. Instead, we can express the conditions in a way that ensures the ownership and count are correctly managed.

Here’s the corrected version of the contract interface with the appropriate postconditions:

```solidity

    mapping (address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;

    mapping (address => mapping (address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

### Changes Made:
1. **Postconditions for `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`:** Removed the conditional expressions and kept the postconditions straightforward. The postconditions now simply state that the `_ownedTokensCount` for `_from` is decremented by 1 and for `_to` is incremented by 1, assuming that the transfer is valid and `_from` is indeed the owner of the token.

These changes should help ensure that the postconditions hold true at the end of their respective functions, addressing the verification errors. If you continue to encounter issues, please provide additional context or details about the function implementations or the surrounding code.
