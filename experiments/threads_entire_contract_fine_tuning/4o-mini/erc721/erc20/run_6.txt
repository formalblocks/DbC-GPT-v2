=== USER [2025-06-08 21:24:45] ===

    
Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Your task is to annotate the functions in the contract below:

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:25:19] ===
Certainly! The error you encountered is due to the use of an undeclared identifier `isApproved` in the postcondition for the `isApprovedForAll` function. Instead, we should directly reference the return value of the function, which is `approved`.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:26:04] ===
The error you encountered indicates that the postcondition for the `transferFrom` function might not hold at the end of the function. This is likely due to the fact that the ownership transfer may not occur if the function fails due to a revert (for example, if the caller is not the owner or if the `_to` address is the zero address).

To fix this, we need to adjust the postconditions for the `transferFrom` function to account for the possibility that the function may not complete successfully. We can do this by using conditional expressions that check whether the transfer was successful.

Here’s the updated contract interface with the corrected postconditions:

In this updated version, the postcondition for `transferFrom` has been modified to include a conditional expression that checks if the transfer was successful. If the transfer was not successful, the state variables should remain unchanged. This should help avoid the verification error you encountered.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:26:55] ===
The error messages indicate that there is a syntax issue in the postcondition for the `transferFrom` function. Specifically, it seems that the postcondition is not correctly formatted, leading to a parsing error.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the postcondition is well-structured and clearly expresses the conditions under which the state variables are updated. We will separate the conditions for successful and unsuccessful transfers more clearly.

```

In this version, I have ensured that the postcondition for `transferFrom` is correctly formatted. The logical structure should now be clear and valid for the verifier. The conditions check that if the transfer is successful, the ownership and counts are updated accordingly, while also maintaining the state if the transfer fails. 

Please try this updated version and let me know if there are any further issues!

The error message indicates that there is a syntax issue in the postcondition for the `transferFrom` function. Specifically, it seems that the postcondition is not properly closed, which is causing a parsing error.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:30:38] ===
The error messages indicate that there is a syntax issue in the postcondition for the `transferFrom` function. Specifically, it seems that the postcondition is not properly closed, which is causing a parsing error. 

To resolve this, we need to ensure that the postcondition is correctly structured and that all logical conditions are properly enclosed. We will also ensure that the conditions are clear and concise.

Here’s the corrected contract interface with properly formatted postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;

    mapping (address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;

    mapping (address => mapping (address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

    bytes4 private constant _INTERFACE_ID_ERC721 = 0x80ac58cd;

```

### Key Changes:
1. **Postcondition Formatting**: The postcondition for `transferFrom` is now properly formatted and closed. Ensure that the logical conditions are clear and concise.
2. **Syntax Correction**: The previous syntax error was due to a missing closing parenthesis. This has been corrected.

Please try this updated version, and it should resolve the verification issues. If there are any further problems, let me know!
