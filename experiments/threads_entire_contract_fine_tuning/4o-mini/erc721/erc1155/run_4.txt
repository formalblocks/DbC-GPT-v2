Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Your task is to annotate the functions in the contract below:

### Changes Made:
1. **`ownerOf` Function**: The postcondition was changed to ensure that if `_tokenId` is not zero, it correctly checks that the owner is the expected address.
2. **`transferFrom` Function**: Added postconditions to ensure that the `_ownedTokensCount` for both the sender and receiver is updated correctly after the transfer. This ensures that the ownership counts are consistent with the transfer operation.

These changes should help in passing the verification checks.

### Changes Made:
1. **`approve` Function**: 
   - The postcondition `_tokenOwner[_tokenId] == msg.sender || _operatorApprovals[_tokenOwner[_tokenId]][msg.sender]` was kept, but we added a condition to ensure that if `_approved` is not the zero address, the `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` must be valid (i.e., not zero).
   
2. **`transferFrom` Function**: 
   - The postconditions were revised to ensure that the ownership count is updated correctly only if the transfer is successful. The postcondition `_tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _from` was kept, but we need to ensure that it reflects the state after the transfer. The checks for `_ownedTokensCount` were retained to ensure the counts are updated correctly.

These adjustments should help in passing the verification checks.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:27:36] ===
To address the verification errors, we need to refine the postconditions for the `approve` and `transferFrom` functions. The errors indicate that certain conditions may not hold at the end of the function execution. 

### Key Adjustments:
1. **`approve` Function**: We need to ensure that the postconditions reflect the fact that the approval can only be set if the caller is the owner or an approved operator. We should also ensure that the `_tokenId` is valid before attempting to approve it.
  
2. **`transferFrom` Function**: We need to ensure that the postconditions correctly reflect the state after the transfer, particularly regarding the ownership and token counts.

Here’s the updated contract interface with revised postconditions:

### Changes Made:

   - The postcondition `_approved == address(0) || _tokenOwner[_tokenId] != address(0)` is kept to ensure that the token exists if an approval is being set.
   - The postcondition `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == _approved` is retained to ensure that the approval is correctly set.

2. **`transferFrom` Function**:
   - The postconditions ensure that the ownership and counts are updated correctly after the transfer. The checks for `_ownedTokensCount` are retained to ensure the counts are updated correctly.

These adjustments should help in passing the verification checks. If there are still issues, we may need to further refine the conditions based on specific contract logic or constraints.

To resolve the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions for the `approve` and `transferFrom` functions accurately reflect the state after execution, considering the constraints of the ERC721 standard.

### Key Adjustments:
1. **`approve` Function**: The postconditions need to ensure that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator, and that the token exists when setting approval.
  
2. **`transferFrom` Function**: The postconditions must ensure that the transfer is valid and that the ownership and token counts are updated correctly.

To address the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions for the `approve`, `transferFrom`, and `safeTransferFrom` functions accurately reflect the state after execution, particularly focusing on the ownership and approval logic.

### Key Adjustments:
1. **`approve` Function**: The postconditions need to ensure that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator, and that the token exists when setting approval. We can also simplify the conditions to ensure they are more robust.

2. **`transferFrom` Function**: The postconditions must ensure that the transfer is valid and that the ownership and token counts are updated correctly. We need to ensure that the token is being transferred from the correct owner.

3. **`safeTransferFrom` Function**: The postconditions must ensure that the token is transferred correctly and that the ownership is updated.

### Changes Made:
1. **`approve` Function**:
   - The postcondition `_tokenOwner[_tokenId] == msg.sender || _operatorApprovals[_tokenOwner[_tokenId]][msg.sender]` is retained to ensure that only the owner or an approved operator can set the approval.
   - The postcondition `_tokenOwner[_tokenId] != address(0) || _approved == address(0)` is modified to ensure that if `_approved` is not zero, the token must exist.
   - The postcondition `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId] == _approved` is retained to ensure that the approval is correctly set.

2. **`transferFrom` Function**:
   - The postconditions ensure that the ownership and counts are updated correctly after the transfer. The checks for `_ownedTokensCount` are retained to ensure the counts are updated correctly.

3. **`safeTransferFrom` Function**:
   - The postconditions ensure that the ownership is updated correctly after the transfer.

These adjustments should help in passing the verification checks. If issues persist, we may need to further refine the conditions based on specific contract logic or constraints.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:33:11] ===
To resolve the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions for the `approve`, `transferFrom`, and `safeTransferFrom` functions accurately reflect the state after execution, particularly focusing on the ownership and approval logic. 

### Key Adjustments:
1. **`approve` Function**: We need to ensure that the postconditions reflect that the caller must be the owner or an approved operator and that the token exists.

2. **`transferFrom` Function**: We need to ensure that the postconditions reflect that the transfer is valid and that the ownership and token counts are updated correctly.

3. **`safeTransferFrom` Function**: We need to ensure that the postconditions reflect that the token is transferred correctly and that the ownership is updated.

Here’s the updated contract interface with refined postconditions:
