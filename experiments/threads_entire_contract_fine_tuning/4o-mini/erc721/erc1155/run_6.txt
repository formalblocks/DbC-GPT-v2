Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Your task is to annotate the functions in the contract below:

### Changes Made:
1. **`ownerOf` Function**: Updated the postcondition to ensure that if `_tokenId` is not zero, it must equal the owner stored in `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]`.
2. **`approve` Function**: Ensured that `_tokenId` is not zero and that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
3. **`getApproved` Function**: Adjusted the postcondition to check that if `_tokenId` is not zero, it must equal the approved address stored in `_tokenApprovals[_tokenId]`.
4. **`transferFrom` Function**: Adjusted the postconditions to ensure that ownership checks are valid and that the token is being transferred correctly.

These adjustments should resolve the verification errors while maintaining the integrity of the contract's specifications.

### Changes Made:
1. **`approve` Function**: Removed the postcondition `_tokenId != 0` since it might not hold if `_tokenId` is indeed zero. Instead, I kept the condition that checks if the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.
  
2. **`transferFrom` Function**: Adjusted the postconditions to account for the case where `_from` and `_to` are the same. This means that the ownership count for `_from` and `_to` should not change if they are the same address. The postconditions now reflect this logic:
   - The decrement for `_ownedTokensCount[_from]` and increment for `_ownedTokensCount[_to]` are conditioned on whether `_from` is equal to `_to`.

These adjustments should resolve the verification errors while maintaining the integrity of the contract's specifications.

### Changes Made:
1. **`transferFrom` Function**: 
   - The postcondition that checks whether the caller is the owner or an approved operator has been retained, but it is now clear that the ownership of the token must be validated before the transfer occurs. The condition is still valid as it ensures that the caller has the right to transfer the token.
   - The postcondition `_tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _from` is kept to ensure that the token is indeed owned by the `_from` address before the transfer.
   - The ownership count adjustments are maintained, ensuring they only change if `_from` and `_to` are different.

These adjustments should resolve the verification errors while maintaining the integrity of the contract's specifications. If the errors persist, we may need to consider additional conditions or checks based on the specific implementation context.

To address the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions for the `transferFrom` function are more robust and accurately reflect the state of the contract after the function execution.

```

### Changes Made:
1. **`transferFrom` Function**:
   - The postcondition `_tokenOwner[_tokenId] == _to` is now specified to ensure that after the transfer, the token is owned by the new owner `_to`.
   - The postcondition that checks the ownership and permissions has been modified to ensure that it only applies when `_tokenId` is valid and that the caller has the right to transfer the token.
   - The ownership count adjustments are maintained, ensuring they reflect the correct state after the transfer.

2. **General Structure**:
   - The postconditions are structured to ensure that they accurately reflect the state of the contract after the function execution, particularly focusing on the ownership and approval checks.

These adjustments should resolve the verification errors while maintaining the integrity of the contract's specifications. If issues persist, we may need to further refine the conditions based on the specific implementation context.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:48:04] ===
The verification errors you're encountering suggest that the postconditions for the `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions are not correctly formatted for the `solc-verify` tool. Specifically, the implication operator (`==>`) is not valid in `solc-verify` annotations. Instead, we need to express the conditions using logical constructs that do not include implications.

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed Implication Operator**: The postconditions now use logical negation and conjunction instead of the implication operator (`==>`). This ensures that the conditions are valid for `solc-verify`.
  
2. **Postcondition Logic**: The conditions ensure that:
   - The `_to` address is not zero.
   - The ownership of the token is correctly transferred to `_to`.
   - The caller has the right to transfer the token, ensuring that the ownership checks are valid.

These adjustments should resolve the verification errors while maintaining the integrity of the contract's specifications. If issues persist, we may need to further refine the conditions based on the specific implementation context.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:48:58] ===
To address the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions for the `transferFrom` function are correctly structured to guarantee that they hold true after the function execution. The current error indicates that the logical expression used in the postcondition may not be valid in all cases.

We can simplify the postconditions to ensure they are clear and directly express the expected state changes without using complex logical expressions that might not hold true.

Here’s the updated contract interface with the corrected postconditions:

### Changes Made:
1. **Postcondition Logic**: The postcondition for ownership checks has been simplified to ensure that it directly checks the ownership of the token and the permissions for transferring it without using complex logical expressions that may not hold true.
   - The condition now explicitly checks that if `_tokenId` is not zero, the ownership and permissions must be valid.
   
2. **Clear Ownership Check**: The ownership check is now separated into its own postcondition to ensure clarity and correctness.

These adjustments should resolve the verification errors while maintaining the integrity of the contract's specifications. If issues persist, we may need to further refine the conditions based on the specific implementation context.
