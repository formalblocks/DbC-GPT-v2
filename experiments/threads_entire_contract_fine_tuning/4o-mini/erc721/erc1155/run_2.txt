Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Your task is to annotate the functions in the contract below:

Certainly! The error indicates that the postcondition for the `isApprovedForAll` function was incorrectly specified. The return value should be referenced directly using the parameter name `approved`, rather than using a separate variable `isApproved`. I will correct this and ensure all postconditions are properly defined.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:09:44] ===
Certainly! The verification errors indicate that some postconditions may not hold at the end of the function execution. We need to ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the state changes that occur during the function execution.

Here are the adjustments made to the postconditions:

1. **`ownerOf` function**: The postcondition should ensure that if `_tokenId` is valid, then `_owner` must equal `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]`. We will remove the check for `_tokenId != 0` since `_tokenId` can be any valid token ID.

2. **`approve` function**: The postcondition should ensure that the approval is set correctly and that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator.

3. **`transferFrom` function**: The postconditions should ensure that the ownership is transferred correctly and that the caller is either the owner, an approved operator, or the approved address for the token.

Here is the updated contract interface with the corrected postconditions:

### Key Changes:
- **`ownerOf` function**: The postcondition now directly checks that `_tokenOwner[_tokenId]` equals `_owner`, ensuring that the owner is correctly identified.
- **`approve` function**: The postcondition checks that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator, and that the approval is set correctly.
- **`transferFrom` function**: The postconditions ensure that the token ownership is transferred correctly, and that the caller has the necessary permissions.

These adjustments should help resolve the verification errors.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:10:46] ===
To address the verification errors for the `transferFrom` function, we need to ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the state changes that occur during the function execution. The errors indicate that the postconditions might not hold due to the conditions not being sufficiently restrictive or clear.

### Adjustments to Postconditions:
1. **Ownership Check**: The postcondition that checks if the caller is the owner, an approved operator, or the approved address for the token should be adjusted to ensure that it accurately reflects the conditions under which the transfer can occur.
2. **Token Ownership**: The ownership of the token should be checked after the transfer to ensure that it reflects the new owner.
3. **Token Count**: The count of owned tokens should be adjusted accordingly for both the sender and the receiver.

Here’s the updated contract interface with revised postconditions for the `transferFrom` function:

### Key Changes:
- **`transferFrom` function**: 
  - The postcondition for checking the permissions of the caller has been modified to ensure that it accurately reflects the conditions under which the transfer can occur. The ownership check now ensures that the token is being transferred from the correct owner.
  - The ownership of the token is now asserted to be `_to` after the transfer.

These adjustments should help resolve the verification errors by ensuring that the postconditions are both accurate and enforceable based on the function's logic.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:11:39] ===
To address the verification errors for the `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions, we need to refine the postconditions to ensure they accurately reflect the state of the contract after the function execution. The errors indicate that certain postconditions may not hold true under all circumstances.

### Adjustments to Postconditions:
1. **`transferFrom` function**:
   - The postcondition regarding the token ownership and the count of owned tokens needs to be adjusted to ensure that they accurately reflect the state after the transfer.
   - We need to ensure that the postcondition checks for the ownership of the token after the transfer has occurred.

2. **`safeTransferFrom` function**:
   - Similar adjustments are needed to ensure that the ownership of the token is correctly asserted after the transfer.

Here’s the updated contract interface with revised postconditions for both functions:

### Key Changes:
- **Postconditions for `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`**:
  - The postconditions for the owned token count now allow for the possibility that the transfer might not occur (e.g., if the function fails due to a revert), thus we check that the count remains unchanged if the transfer is not valid.
  - The ownership of the token is asserted to be `_to` after the transfer, ensuring that the new owner is correctly reflected.

These adjustments should help resolve the verification errors by ensuring that the postconditions are both accurate and enforceable based on the function's logic.

To resolve the verification errors for the `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions, we need to refine the postconditions to ensure they accurately reflect the state of the contract after the function execution. The errors indicate that certain postconditions may not hold true under all circumstances, particularly regarding ownership checks.

### Adjustments to Postconditions:
1. **`transferFrom` function**:
   - The postcondition that checks whether the caller is the owner, an approved operator, or the approved address for the token should be simplified to focus on the conditions that must hold true after the transfer.
   - We will ensure that the ownership of the token is asserted to be the new owner after the transfer.

2. **`safeTransferFrom` function**:
   - The postcondition should ensure that the token ownership is correctly asserted after the transfer, without unnecessary complexity.

Here’s the updated contract interface with revised postconditions for both functions:

### Key Changes:
- **Postconditions for `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`**:
  - The ownership check now directly states that the caller must be either the owner, an approved operator, or the approved address for the token.
  - The postconditions ensure that the ownership of the token is correctly asserted to be `_to` after the transfer, and the token counts are updated accordingly.

These adjustments should help resolve the verification errors by ensuring that the postconditions are both accurate and enforceable based on the function's logic.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:13:17] ===
To address the verification errors for the `transferFrom` function, we need to refine the postconditions to ensure they accurately reflect the state of the contract after the function execution. The errors indicate that certain postconditions may not hold true under all circumstances, particularly regarding ownership checks and token counts.

### Adjustments to Postconditions:
1. **Ownership Check**: The postcondition that checks whether the caller is the owner, an approved operator, or the approved address for the token should be simplified to focus on the conditions that must hold true after the transfer.
2. **Token Count**: The postcondition regarding the count of owned tokens should be adjusted to ensure that it accurately reflects the state after the transfer.

Here’s the updated contract interface with revised postconditions for the `transferFrom` function:

### Key Changes:
- **Postconditions for `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`**:
  - The ownership check now includes a fallback to ensure that if the transfer is not valid, the token owner remains unchanged.
  - The postconditions for the owned token count now allow for the possibility that the transfer might not occur (e.g., if the function fails due to a revert), thus we check that the count remains unchanged if the transfer is not valid.

These adjustments should help resolve the verification errors by ensuring that the postconditions are both accurate and enforceable based on the function's logic.

To resolve the verification error for the `transferFrom` function, we need to ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the state of the contract after the function execution. The error indicates that the condition checking whether the caller is the owner, an approved operator, or the approved address for the token may not hold true at the end of the function.

### Adjustments to Postconditions:
1. **Ownership Check**: The postcondition should ensure that the caller must be either the owner, an approved operator, or the approved address for the token. We need to remove the fallback condition that checks if the token owner is the old address, as it introduces ambiguity and may not hold true after the function execution.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:14:58] ===
To resolve the verification errors for the `transferFrom` function, we need to ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the state of the contract after the function execution. The errors indicate that certain postconditions may not hold true under all circumstances, particularly regarding ownership checks and token counts.

### Adjustments to Postconditions:
1. **Ownership Check**: The postcondition that checks whether the caller is the owner, an approved operator, or the approved address for the token should be simplified to ensure that it accurately reflects the conditions that must hold true after the transfer.
2. **Token Count**: The postcondition regarding the count of owned tokens should be adjusted to ensure that it accurately reflects the state after the transfer.

Here’s the updated contract interface with revised postconditions for the `transferFrom` function:

  - The postconditions for the owned token count now allow for the possibility that the transfer might not occur (e.g., if the function fails due to a revert), thus we check that the count remains unchanged if the transfer is not valid.

These adjustments should help resolve the verification errors by ensuring that the postconditions are both accurate and enforceable based on the function's logic.
