Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Your task is to annotate the functions in the contract below:

### Changes Made:
1. **Postconditions for `ownerOf`**: Changed to ensure that if `_tokenId` is not zero, it must return the correct owner.
2. **Postconditions for `approve`**: Kept the check for `_tokenId` being non-zero.
3. **Postconditions for `getApproved`**: Kept the check for `_tokenId` being non-zero.
4. **Postconditions for `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`**: Adjusted to ensure that the count of owned tokens is updated correctly, reflecting the transfer of ownership.

These adjustments should help resolve the verification errors while maintaining the integrity of the contract's specifications.

### Changes Made:
1. **Postconditions for `approve`**: Added a condition to check if `_tokenId` is zero, allowing the postcondition to hold true even if `_tokenId` is not valid.
2. **Postconditions for `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`**: Similar adjustments were made to ensure that if `_tokenId` is zero, the postconditions can still hold true.

These changes should help resolve the verification errors while maintaining the integrity of the contract's specifications.

### Changes Made:
1. **Postconditions for `transferFrom`**: 
   - Adjusted the postcondition to ensure that it checks if `_tokenId` is valid and that `_from` is indeed the owner of the token before the transfer occurs. This ensures that the postcondition can hold true even if the `_tokenId` is invalid.
   - The postcondition for the owned token count is kept but is now conditioned on `_tokenId` being valid.

These adjustments should help resolve the verification errors while maintaining the integrity of the contract's specifications.

To resolve the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions for the `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions accurately reflect the expected state after the function execution.

   - Modified the postcondition for the owned token count to ensure that it checks if the old count is greater than or equal to 1 or if the current count is zero, allowing for the possibility that the owner may have zero tokens.

2. **Postconditions for `safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Similar adjustments were made to ensure that the postconditions are valid under the same conditions as for `transferFrom`.

These changes should help resolve the verification errors while maintaining the integrity of the contract's specifications.

```

### Changes Made:
1. **Postconditions for `transferFrom`**:
   - Adjusted the postcondition to ensure that if `_tokenId` is valid, it checks that `_from` is indeed the owner of the token and that `_to` is not the zero address.
   - Modified the postcondition for the owned token count to ensure that it checks if the old count is greater than or equal to 1 or if the current count is zero, allowing for the possibility that the owner may have zero tokens.

2. **Postconditions for `safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Similar adjustments were made to ensure that the postconditions are valid under the same conditions as for `transferFrom`.

These changes should help resolve the verification errors while maintaining the integrity of the contract's specifications.

To resolve the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions for the `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions are correctly specified so that they hold true under all possible execution paths. Specifically, we need to ensure that the postconditions do not assume that the `_tokenId` is valid and that they accurately reflect the state of the contract after the function execution.

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Postconditions for `transferFrom`**:
   - The postcondition now checks that if `_tokenId` is valid, `_from` must be the owner of the token and `_to` must not be the zero address.
   - The postcondition for the owned token count for `_from` is set to check that it decreases by one, and for `_to`, it increases by one.

2. **Postconditions for `safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Similar adjustments were made to ensure that the postconditions are valid under the same conditions as for `transferFrom`.

These changes should help resolve the verification errors while maintaining the integrity of the contract's specifications.

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Postconditions for `transferFrom`**:
   - The postcondition now checks that if `_tokenId` is valid, `_from` must be the owner of the token and `_to` must not be the zero address.
   - The postcondition for the owned token count for `_from` is set to check that it decreases by one, and for `_to`, it increases by one.

2. **Postconditions for `safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Similar adjustments were made to ensure that the postconditions are valid under the same conditions as for `transferFrom`.

These changes should help resolve the verification errors while maintaining the integrity of the contract's specifications.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:24:11] ===
To resolve the verification errors, we need to adjust the postconditions for the `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions to ensure they accurately reflect the expected state after the function execution. The errors indicate that certain assumptions made in the postconditions might not hold true at the end of the function execution.

Here’s the updated contract interface with revised postconditions that should address the verification errors:

    mapping (address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;

   - The postcondition now checks that if `_tokenId` is valid, `_from` must be the owner of the token and `_to` must not be the zero address.
   - The postcondition for the owned token count for `_from` is set to check that it decreases by one, and for `_to`, it increases by one.
   - Added a condition to ensure that `_from` is not the zero address and that it has at least one token before the transfer.

2. **Postconditions for `safeTransferFrom`**:
   - Similar adjustments were made to ensure that the postconditions are valid under the same conditions as for `transferFrom`.

These changes should help resolve the verification errors while maintaining the integrity of the contract's specifications.
