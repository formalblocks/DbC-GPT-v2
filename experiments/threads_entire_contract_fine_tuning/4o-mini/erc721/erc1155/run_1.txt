Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Your task is to annotate the functions in the contract below:

Sure! It looks like the postcondition for the `isApprovedForAll` function was incorrectly referencing a variable `isApproved` that does not exist. Instead, we should directly reference the return value of the function. Here’s the corrected version of the contract interface with the appropriate postconditions:

This version should resolve the errors related to undeclared identifiers by correctly using the return variable `approved` in the `isApprovedForAll` function's postcondition.

Certainly! The errors indicate that some postconditions might not hold at the end of the function execution. Specifically, we need to adjust the postconditions for the `ownerOf`, `approve`, and `transferFrom` functions to ensure they accurately reflect the state after the function execution.

### Changes Made:
1. **`ownerOf` Function**: The postcondition was modified to ensure that if `_tokenId` is not zero, it checks that the owner is correctly set.
2. **`approve` Function**: The postcondition was adjusted to ensure that if the approval is changed, it reflects the new approved address or retains the old one if unchanged.
3. **`transferFrom` Function**: The postcondition was kept to ensure that the token owner is correctly set to `_from` and `_to` is not zero, while also checking the ownership count for both the sender and receiver.

These adjustments should help ensure that the postconditions hold true at the end of the function execution, addressing the verification errors.

### Changes Made:
1. **`approve` Function**: The postcondition was modified to ensure that it only checks if the caller is either the owner or an approved operator. The check for the old approval value was removed since it might not hold true after the function execution.
  
2. **`transferFrom` Function**: The postcondition was kept to ensure that the token owner is correctly set to `_from` and `_to` is not zero, while also checking the ownership count for both the sender and receiver. The previous checks were retained as they are still valid.

These adjustments should help ensure that the postconditions hold true at the end of the function execution, addressing the verification errors.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 21:05:57] ===
To resolve the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions for the `approve` and `transferFrom` functions accurately reflect the state after the function execution. The errors indicate that the postconditions may not hold true based on the logic of the contract.

### Key Adjustments:
1. **`approve` Function**: The postcondition should ensure that the caller is either the owner or an approved operator, but we should not assume that the approval will always change the state in a way that can be verified directly in the postcondition.
  
2. **`transferFrom` Function**: The postcondition should ensure that the ownership is transferred correctly, but we need to account for the fact that the function might revert before the ownership is updated.

Here’s the revised contract interface with the necessary adjustments:

To address the verification errors, we need to refine the postconditions for the `approve` function. The error indicates that the postcondition `_tokenOwner[_tokenId] == msg.sender || _operatorApprovals[_tokenOwner[_tokenId]][msg.sender]` might not hold true at the end of the function execution. 

### Key Adjustments:
1. **`approve` Function**: We need to ensure that the postcondition reflects that the approval can be set without assuming the caller's status as an owner or operator. Instead, we should focus on the approval being set correctly.

2. **Ownership Checks**: We should avoid postconditions that rely on the state of the `_tokenOwner` mapping since the approval process does not change ownership.
