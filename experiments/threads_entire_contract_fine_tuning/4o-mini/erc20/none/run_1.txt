Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Your task is to annotate the functions in the contract below:

    
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

Certainly! The errors indicate that the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions are not correctly capturing the state changes when the transfer amount is zero. We need to ensure that the postconditions reflect the correct state after the function execution, especially considering the case when `_value` is zero.

Here’s the corrected version of the contract interface with updated postconditions:

```solidity

    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value

    /**

    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

In this updated version, the postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom` now correctly account for the case when `_value` is zero, ensuring that the balances remain unchanged in that scenario. This should resolve the verification errors.

The errors indicate that the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions are still not correctly formulated to account for the state changes that occur during the function execution. Specifically, the postconditions must ensure that the balances are only modified when the transfer amount is greater than zero, and that they remain unchanged when the transfer amount is zero.

To fix this, we need to separate the conditions based on whether `_value` is zero or not. Here’s the revised contract interface with corrected postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /// @notice postcondition _value == 0 || _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom`:** 
   - The conditions now check if `_value` is zero. If it is, the balances remain unchanged, and if it is not, the balances are adjusted accordingly.
   - This ensures that the postconditions hold true regardless of whether `_value` is zero or greater than zero.

This should resolve the verification errors.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 18:00:27] ===
The errors indicate that the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions are still not correctly capturing the state changes, particularly in relation to the balance checks. 

To resolve this, we need to ensure that the postconditions account for the fact that a transfer can only occur if the sender has enough balance. If the transfer amount is zero, the balances should remain unchanged, but if it is non-zero, we need to check that the sender has sufficient balance before the transfer occurs.

Here’s the updated contract interface with corrected postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Added Preconditions for Transfers:**
   - For both `transfer` and `transferFrom`, I added a postcondition that checks if `_value` is greater than zero, then the sender must have a balance greater than or equal to `_value` before the transfer occurs.
   - This ensures that the function cannot be called unless the sender has sufficient balance, thus preventing the postcondition from failing.

These changes should help ensure that the postconditions hold true after the function execution, resolving the verification errors.

The errors indicate that the use of the implication operator (`==>`) in the postconditions is causing issues with the verification process. The `solc-verify` annotations do not support the implication operator directly. Instead, we can express the conditions using logical constructs that do not rely on implications.

To fix this, we will rewrite the postconditions to avoid using the implication operator. We can use logical OR (`||`) to express the conditions more directly. Here’s the revised contract interface:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]

}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Removed Implication Operator:**
   - The postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom` now avoid using the implication operator (`==>`). Instead, they use logical constructs that can be expressed without implications.

2. **Logical Conditions:**
   - The conditions check if `_value` is greater than zero and ensure that the necessary balances are sufficient before the transfer occurs.

This should resolve the verification errors and allow the contract to be verified successfully.

The errors indicate that the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions are not accurately reflecting the state changes, particularly in relation to the balances. Specifically, the conditions should ensure that the balances are only modified when the transfer amount is greater than zero and that they remain unchanged when the transfer amount is zero.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the postconditions correctly express the necessary conditions for both cases (when `_value` is zero and when it is greater than zero). Here’s the updated contract interface with corrected postconditions:

   - The conditions are expressed in a way that avoids using implications directly, ensuring that they can be verified correctly.

2. **Ensured Balance Checks:**
   - The checks for sufficient balances are now clearly stated, ensuring that they are only evaluated when `_value` is greater than zero.

This should resolve the verification errors and allow the contract to be verified successfully. If further adjustments are needed, we can refine the conditions based on the specific requirements of the `solc-verify` tool.

### Key Changes:
1. **Removed Implication Operator:**
   - The implication operator (`==>`) has been completely removed from the postconditions. Instead, we will express the conditions in a way that does not rely on implications.

2. **Logical Conditions:**
   - The conditions now check if `_value` is greater than zero and ensure that the necessary balances are sufficient before the transfer occurs.

### Revised Postconditions:
To ensure that the postconditions are valid and correctly express the intended logic, we can rewrite them as follows:

- For `transfer`:
  - If `_value` is zero, the balances remain unchanged.
  - If `_value` is greater than zero, then the sender's balance must be sufficient.

- For `transferFrom`:
  - If `_value` is zero, the balances remain unchanged.
  - If `_value` is greater than zero, then both the sender's balance and the allowance must be sufficient.

Here’s the corrected version with proper logical constructs:

```solidity

### Summary of Changes:
- The postconditions now use logical constructs that do not rely on implications.
- Each condition checks for both the case when `_value` is zero and when it is greater than zero, ensuring that the state changes are correctly represented.

This should resolve the verification errors and allow the contract to be verified successfully.

The errors indicate that the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions are still not correctly capturing the state changes. Specifically, the conditions must ensure that the balances are only modified when the transfer amount is greater than zero and that they remain unchanged when the transfer amount is zero.

To resolve this, we need to express the postconditions in a way that guarantees they hold true after the function execution. The key is to ensure that we are checking for sufficient balances only when `_value` is greater than zero and to make sure that the balances remain unchanged when `_value` is zero.

Here’s the corrected contract interface with updated postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;

    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

```

### Key Changes:
1. **Postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom`:**
   - The conditions now explicitly check if `_value` is zero. If it is, the balances remain unchanged.
   - If `_value` is greater than zero, we check that the sender has sufficient balance before the transfer occurs.
   - The postconditions ensure that the balances are adjusted correctly based on the transfer amount.

2. **Logical Structure:**
   - The logical structure of the postconditions is designed to ensure that they hold true regardless of the value of `_value`.

This should resolve the verification errors and allow the contract to be verified successfully. If further adjustments are needed, we can refine the conditions based on the specific requirements of the `solc-verify` tool.

The errors indicate that the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions are still not accurately capturing the state changes, particularly regarding the balance checks. The postconditions must ensure that the balances are only modified when the transfer amount is greater than zero and that they remain unchanged when the transfer amount is zero.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the postconditions clearly express the necessary conditions without introducing ambiguity. Specifically, we should avoid checking the balance against the transfer amount in the postconditions, as this can lead to situations where the postcondition might not hold.

Here’s the corrected contract interface with updated postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.

    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply

    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_from][msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_allowed[_from][msg.sender]) - _value || _value == 0
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom`:**
   - The conditions now check if `_value` is zero. If it is, the balances remain unchanged.
   - If `_value` is greater than zero, the balances are adjusted accordingly without checking against the transfer amount in a way that could lead to a failure of the postcondition.

2. **Removed Redundant Checks:**
   - The checks for sufficient balances before the transfer are not included in the postconditions, as the function's logic should ensure that the transfer only occurs if the sender has enough balance.

This should resolve the verification errors and allow the contract to be verified successfully. If further adjustments are needed, we can refine the conditions based on the specific requirements of the `solc-verify` tool.
