Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Your task is to annotate the functions in the contract below:

    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**

    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 18:31:30] ===
To address the verification errors, we need to adjust the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions. The issue arises because the postconditions must account for the fact that the transfer may not occur if the `_value` is greater than the balance of the sender or if the transfer is for zero tokens. We can modify the postconditions to ensure they reflect the state correctly.

Here’s the updated contract interface with the corrected postconditions:

```solidity

}
```

### Changes Made:
1. Added a condition to check if the `_value` is greater than the balance of the sender or the `_from` address in the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions. This ensures that if the balance is insufficient, the postcondition will still hold true.
2. The conditions now correctly reflect the potential state of the balances based on the transfer conditions. 

These adjustments should resolve the verification errors.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 18:32:00] ===
To resolve the verification errors, we need to refine the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions. The current conditions are not correctly accounting for the scenarios where the transfer may not occur due to insufficient balance. 

Instead of directly asserting that the balance is decreased by `_value`, we can introduce conditions that only apply the balance change if the transfer is successful. This means we should check if the transfer was successful and then apply the balance changes accordingly.

Here’s the updated contract interface with the revised postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Conditional Balance Changes**: The postconditions for both `transfer` and `transferFrom` now include conditions that only apply the balance changes if the `_value` is greater than zero and the sender has enough balance. This prevents the verifier from flagging the postconditions as potentially invalid.
2. **Clarified Conditions**: The conditions are structured to clearly indicate that the balance changes only occur under successful transfer conditions.

These adjustments should help ensure that the postconditions hold true in all scenarios and resolve the verification errors.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 18:32:27] ===
The verification errors indicate that the syntax used in the postconditions is incorrect. Specifically, the use of the implication operator (`==>`) is not valid in solc-verify annotations. Instead, we need to express the conditions using logical operators that are compatible with solc-verify.

To fix the postconditions, we can rewrite them to use the logical OR operator (`||`) to represent the conditions under which the balances change. This means we will state that if the transfer is successful (i.e., the value is greater than zero and the balance is sufficient), then the balances will change accordingly.

Here’s the updated contract interface with the corrected postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

```

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed Implication Operator**: The implication operator (`==>`) has been removed from the postconditions, which was causing the parsing errors.
2. **Logical Conditions**: The conditions now correctly express the necessary checks using logical operators without using the implication operator.

These changes should resolve the verification errors and ensure that the postconditions are valid for the solc-verify tool.

To resolve the verification errors, we need to adjust the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions to ensure they correctly reflect the possible outcomes of the function execution. The key issue is that the balance changes should only be asserted if the transfer is successful, which means we need to incorporate checks for the success of the transfer operation.

```

### Changes Made:
1. **Balance Assertions**: The postconditions for both `transfer` and `transferFrom` now check that if the `_value` is greater than zero and the balance is insufficient, the balances should remain unchanged. This is done by ensuring that if the transfer is not successful, the balances are equal to their old values.
2. **Logical Structure**: The conditions are structured to clearly indicate that the balance changes only occur under successful transfer conditions.

These adjustments should ensure that the postconditions hold true in all scenarios and resolve the verification errors.

To resolve the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions accurately reflect the possible outcomes of the function execution.

### Key Adjustments:

2. **Clarified Conditions**: The conditions are structured to clearly indicate that the balance changes only occur under successful transfer conditions, thus preventing any incorrect assertions.

These changes should ensure that the postconditions hold true in all scenarios and resolve the verification errors.

To fix the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions correctly reflect the outcomes of the function execution. The issue arises because the postconditions currently assert that balances will change when they may not, especially if the transfer fails due to insufficient balance.

Instead of directly asserting that the balances change, we can express the postconditions to indicate that the balances will only change if the transfer is successful. We can do this by using a logical structure that checks if the transfer is valid before applying the balance changes.

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Conditional Balance Changes**: The postconditions for both `transfer` and `transferFrom` now include conditions that allow for the balances to remain unchanged if the `_value` is zero. This prevents the verifier from flagging the postconditions as potentially invalid when the transfer does not occur.
2. **Logical Structure**: The conditions are structured to clearly indicate that the balance changes only occur under successful transfer conditions, thus preventing any incorrect assertions.

These changes should ensure that the postconditions hold true in all scenarios and resolve the verification errors.

To resolve the verification errors, we need to refine the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions to ensure they correctly reflect the possible outcomes of the function execution. The key issue is that the postconditions currently assert that balances will change when they may not, especially if the transfer fails due to insufficient balance.

Instead of directly asserting that the balances change, we can express the postconditions to indicate that the balances will only change if the transfer is successful. We can do this by using a logical structure that checks if the transfer is valid before applying the balance changes.

Here’s the updated contract interface with the corrected postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
