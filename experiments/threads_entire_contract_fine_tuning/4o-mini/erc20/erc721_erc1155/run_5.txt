Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Your task is to annotate the functions in the contract below:

    
    ```solidity

    */

    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**

    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    $ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

<eip>
## Simple Summary

A standard interface for tokens.


## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for tokens within smart contracts.
This standard provides basic functionality to transfer tokens, as well as allow tokens to be approved so they can be spent by another on-chain third party.


## Motivation

A standard interface allows any tokens on Ethereum to be re-used by other applications: from wallets to decentralized exchanges.


## Specification

## Token
### Methods

**NOTES**:
 - The following specifications use syntax from Solidity `0.4.17` (or above)
 - Callers MUST handle `false` from `returns (bool success)`.  Callers MUST NOT assume that `false` is never returned!


#### name

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.


``` js
function name() public view returns (string)
```


#### symbol

Returns the symbol of the token. E.g. "HIX".

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function symbol() public view returns (string)
```



#### decimals

Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token amount by `100000000` to get its user representation.

OPTIONAL - This method can be used to improve usability,
but interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect these values to be present.

``` js
function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
```


#### totalSupply

Returns the total token supply.

``` js
function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
```



#### balanceOf

Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.

``` js
function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
```



#### transfer

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### transferFrom

Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.

The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.

*Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.

``` js
function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```



#### approve

Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.

**NOTE**: To prevent attack vectors like the one [described here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/) and discussed [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20#issuecomment-263524729),
clients SHOULD make sure to create user interfaces in such a way that they set the allowance first to `0` before setting it to another value for the same spender.
THOUGH The contract itself shouldn't enforce it, to allow backwards compatibility with contracts deployed before

``` js
function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
```


#### allowance

Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.

``` js
function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
```



### Events


#### Transfer

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens SHOULD trigger a Transfer event with the `_from` address set to `0x0` when tokens are created.

``` js
event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
```



#### Approval

MUST trigger on any successful call to `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)`.

``` js
event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)
```

Certainly! The errors indicate that the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions need to be adjusted to ensure they account for the possibility of failing conditions, such as when the transfer amount is zero or when the allowance is not sufficient. Here’s the updated contract interface with corrected postconditions:

    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Transfer Function**:
   - Added a postcondition to ensure that if `_value` is greater than 0, the caller's balance must be sufficient to cover the transfer.

2. **TransferFrom Function**:
   - Added a similar postcondition to ensure that if `_value` is greater than 0, the `_from` address must have a sufficient balance to cover the transfer.

These changes ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the state of the contract after the function execution, addressing the verification errors.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?
            

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 18:26:32] ===
The errors indicate that the use of the implication operator (`==>`) is not valid in the solc-verify postconditions. Instead, we can use a combination of logical conditions to express the same intent without using implications. 

Here’s the corrected contract interface with appropriate postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

### Changes Made:
1. **Removed Implication Operator**: 
   - Replaced the implication (`==>`) with a conditional expression using `=>` in the postconditions for both `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions.
   - Added explicit checks for when `_value` is zero to ensure that the balances remain unchanged in that case.

These adjustments should resolve the verification errors and ensure that the postconditions are valid in the context of solc-verify.

The errors indicate that the use of the implication operator (`=>`) is still not valid in the solc-verify postconditions. Instead, we can express the conditions using logical disjunctions (OR) and negations to ensure that the conditions are valid without using implications.

Here’s the updated contract interface with corrected postconditions:

### Changes Made:
1. **Replaced Implication with Negation**:
   - Changed the postconditions for `transfer` and `transferFrom` to use negation (`!(0 < _value)`) instead of implications. This checks if `_value` is greater than zero and ensures that the balance conditions hold true accordingly.

These adjustments should resolve the verification errors and ensure that the postconditions are valid in the context of solc-verify.

To address the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the state changes that occur during the execution of the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions. Specifically, we need to account for the conditions under which the functions can fail, such as insufficient balance or allowance.

Here’s the updated contract interface with revised postconditions:

```solidity

```

### Changes Made:
1. **Transfer Function**:
   - Updated the postconditions to ensure that if `_value` is not zero, the balances are adjusted accordingly. 
   - Added a condition to check that the caller's balance must be sufficient to cover the transfer.

2. **TransferFrom Function**:
   - Similar updates were made to ensure that if `_value` is not zero, the balances are adjusted correctly.
   - Ensured that the allowance check is included and that the balance of `_from` is sufficient to cover the transfer.

These changes should resolve the verification errors by ensuring that the postconditions accurately reflect the possible states after the function execution.

To address the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the state changes and account for the scenarios where the function may revert due to insufficient balance or allowance. 

The key points to consider are:
1. The `transfer` function should ensure that if the transfer is successful, the balance of the sender decreases by `_value` and the balance of the recipient increases by `_value`.
2. The `transferFrom` function should ensure that the allowance is sufficient and that the balances are updated accordingly.

Here’s the updated contract interface with refined postconditions:

```solidity

### Changes Made:
1. **Transfer Function**:

2. **TransferFrom Function**:
   - Added a postcondition to ensure that both `_from` and `_to` addresses are not the zero address.
   - Ensured that the allowance check is included, which must hold true for the transfer to be valid.

These changes should help clarify the conditions under which the functions operate and ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected state after execution, addressing the verification errors.

To resolve the verification errors, we need to refine the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions to ensure they accurately reflect the conditions under which the functions can execute successfully. Specifically, we need to ensure that we handle cases where the function may revert due to insufficient balance or allowance.

### Key Considerations:
1. **Transfer Function**:
   - The balance of the sender should only decrease if the transfer is successful and the value is greater than zero.
   - The balance of the recipient should only increase if the transfer is successful and the value is greater than zero.
   - We need to ensure that the sender has enough balance before the transfer.

2. **TransferFrom Function**:
   - The allowance must be checked to ensure that the sender is allowed to transfer the specified amount.
   - The balance of the `_from` address should only decrease if the transfer is successful and the value is greater than zero.
   - The balance of the `_to` address should only increase if the transfer is successful and the value is greater than zero.

Here’s the updated contract interface with corrected postconditions:

   - Updated the postcondition to ensure that both the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases only if `_value` is greater than zero.
   - Added a condition to check that the sender's balance is sufficient before the transfer.

2. **TransferFrom Function**:
   - Similar updates were made to ensure that both the `_from` balance decreases and the `_to` balance increases only if `_value` is greater than zero.
   - Ensured that the allowance check is included and that both `_from` and `_to` addresses are not the zero address.

These adjustments should help ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected state after execution, addressing the verification errors.

=== ASSISTANT [2025-06-08 18:28:48] ===
To resolve the verification errors, we need to ensure that the postconditions for the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions accurately reflect the state changes and account for the scenarios where the function may revert due to insufficient balance or allowance. 

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Transfer Function**:
   - The balance of the sender should only decrease if the transfer is successful and the value is greater than zero.
   - The balance of the recipient should only increase if the transfer is successful and the value is greater than zero.
   - We need to ensure that the sender has enough balance before the transfer.

2. **TransferFrom Function**:
   - The allowance must be checked to ensure that the sender is allowed to transfer the specified amount.
   - The balance of the `_from` address should only decrease if the transfer is successful and the value is greater than zero.
   - The balance of the `_to` address should only increase if the transfer is successful and the value is greater than zero.

Here’s the updated contract interface with refined postconditions:

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

contract ERC20 {

    mapping (address => uint) _balances;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) _allowed;
    uint public _totalSupply;

    /**
    * Returns the total token supply.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition supply == _totalSupply
    function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256 supply);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` if the message caller's account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _value == 0 || (_balances[msg.sender] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) - _value)
    /// @notice postcondition _value == 0 || (_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value)
    /// @notice postcondition __verifier_old_uint(_balances[msg.sender]) >= _value
    /// @notice postcondition _to != address(0)
    function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Transfers `_value` amount of tokens from address `_from` to address `_to`, and MUST fire the `Transfer` event.
    * The `transferFrom` method is used for a withdraw workflow, allowing contracts to transfer tokens on your behalf.
    * This can be used for example to allow a contract to transfer tokens on your behalf and/or to charge fees in sub-currencies.
    * The function SHOULD `throw` unless the `_from` account has deliberately authorized the sender of the message via some mechanism.
    * *Note* Transfers of 0 values MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `Transfer` event.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _value == 0 || (_balances[_from] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) - _value)
    /// @notice postcondition _value == 0 || (_balances[_to] == __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_to]) + _value)
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[_from][msg.sender] >= _value
    /// @notice postcondition __verifier_old_uint(_balances[_from]) >= _value
    /// @notice postcondition _from != address(0) && _to != address(0)
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Allows `_spender` to withdraw from your account multiple times, up to the `_value` amount. If this function is called again it overwrites the current allowance with `_value`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition _allowed[msg.sender][_spender] == _value
    function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);

    /**
    * Returns the account balance of another account with address `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition balance == _balances[_owner]
    function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance);

    /**
    * Returns the amount which `_spender` is still allowed to withdraw from `_owner`.
    */
    /// @notice postcondition remaining == _allowed[_owner][_spender]
    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Transfer Function**:
   - Updated the postconditions to ensure that the sender's balance decreases and the recipient's balance increases only if `_value` is greater than zero.
   - The condition checking that the sender's balance is sufficient is retained.

2. **TransferFrom Function**:
   - Similar updates were made to ensure that both the `_from` balance decreases and the `_to` balance increases only if `_value` is greater than zero.
   - The allowance check is included, ensuring that the allowance is sufficient for the transfer.

These adjustments should help ensure that the postconditions accurately reflect the expected state after execution, addressing the verification errors.
