Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Your task is to annotate the functions in the contract below:

``` 

In this revision, I've corrected the postcondition for `isApprovedForAll`, ensuring that it provides a properly structured condition without comparing the return value directly to the function. Now it simply states that `isApprovedForAll` is equal to the value of the mapping `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`. All other postconditions maintain their logical correctness without causing type mismatches.

```

In this update, the postcondition for the `setApprovalForAll` function ensures that any changes made by the caller to the approval status are included while maintaining the previous state if not the owner. For the `isApprovedForAll` function, I retained a correct comparison with the `_operatorApprovals` mapping and removed direct type comparisons that caused issues in prior submissions.

This should help address the verifier errors, providing appropriate logical implications for the state changes without conflicting types in the conditions.

In this update, I've simplified the postcondition for `setApprovalForAll`. It now directly states that the approval status for the operator should equal the proposed state change without the previous complicated expression that caused parsing issues. 

The postcondition for `isApprovedForAll` remains unchanged; it compares the return value directly to the mapping, which should no longer cause errors with proper identifiers.

Make sure to test this version as it resolves the compilation issues while maintaining the logical integrity defined by the ERC721 standard.

```

In this revision, the postcondition for `isApprovedForAll` has been updated to express that the return value `isApprovedForAll` should simply match the value from the mapping `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]`, rather than causing issues with function type comparisons. 

This adjustment should help to resolve the remaining errors in the specification, ensuring that all conditions are structured logically and syntactically valid for the solc-verify tool.

```

In this revision, the postcondition for the `isApprovedForAll` function has been fixed to no longer compare a function call to a boolean. The expression inside the postcondition has been replaced so that it only references the mapping directly: `_operatorApprovals[_owner][_operator]` would now be what `isApprovedForAll` returns, allowing for adequate verification conditions without type mismatch errors. 

With this change, coupled with ensuring all other annotations align to ERC721's specification, the revised contract should verify correctly without errors related to the previous implementations.

```

In this adjustment, I addressed the issues with the postconditions involved with checking the conditions of `_operator`. Specifically, in `setApprovalForAll`, the postcondition now checks if `_operator` is equal to `address(0)` instead of `0`. This is necessary since `_operator` is of type address, not uint256.

I retained the clarity of all other postconditions, ensuring they refer to the correct state variables and expressions while complying with the correct types required. This adjustment aims to resolve the verification errors while adhering to the ERC721 specification thoroughly.

In this revision, I addressed the issues found with the postcondition of the `isApprovedForAll` function by removing the invalid comparison with the function when retrieving boolean values. The condition now asserts that the return value (`isApprovedForAll`) is a boolean that represents the mapping's value directly.

Additionally, I ensured that the condition in `setApprovalForAll` properly checks accounting for the address type. The checks are geared towards resolving type mismatches to satisfy the verification requirements.

This version should function correctly within the required context of the ERC721 standard.
