=== USER [2025-05-30 10:12:29] ===

    
Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Your task is to annotate the functions in the contract below:

### Changes Made:
1. Fixed the quantified postcondition for `balanceOfBatch` to properly reference the state variable `_balances` without nested parentheses.
2. Corrected the postconditions for `safeBatchTransferFrom` to allow for the _from address being zero when tokens are minted.
3. Ensured all parameters in postconditions directly reflect the expectations detailed in the EIP standard.

### Changes Made:
1. Changed the postcondition for `safeTransferFrom` to correctly check that either tokens are being minted (which allows `_from` to be `address(0)`) or that the balance adjustment is correctly calculated.
2. Ensured that the addition and subtraction referenced within postconditions are formatted without ambiguity for clarity in expected states.
3. The logic for transfers now appropriately handles both token transfers and minting cases.

### Changes Made:
1. Updated the postcondition in `safeTransferFrom` to remove the condition `_value > 0`, since this specifically did not hold when transferring tokens without minting.
2. The new postcondition correctly checks only if `_from` is the zero address or whether the balance for the `_from` address is decreased correctly in the case of a normal transfer.
3. This specification now addresses the possible issues pointed out by the verifier while maintaining correct formal logic.

### Changes Made:
1. Updated the postcondition in `safeTransferFrom` to check that no balance reduction occurs when `_value` is zero.
2. Updated the postcondition in `safeBatchTransferFrom` similarly to allow for `_values[i] == 0` handling, ensuring that transfers can include zero values without affecting the overall state transitions.
3. Now both functions have postconditions that accurately reflect their operational behavior without false assumptions about the changes in balances when calling with zero values.

### Changes Made:
1. Adjusted the postcondition for `safeTransferFrom` to include the condition where `_from` is zero while allowing for cases where `_value` might be zero as well.
2. Updated the postcondition in `safeBatchTransferFrom` similarly, ensuring it checks for both standard transfers and minting scenarios as valid.
3. This updated specification correctly reflects the functional behavior of the contract while addressing the potential state change issues highlighted by the verifier, ensuring it does not falsely assume conditions cannot occur under valid circumstances.

### Changes Made:
1. Modified the postcondition in `safeTransferFrom` to require that if `_value` is not zero, `_balances[_id][_from]` must be greater than or equal to the previous balance to ensure no invalid state occurs if `_from` is non-zero.
2. Added a separate check in `safeBatchTransferFrom` to ensure that if `_values[i]` is not zero, we check the balance condition appropriately.
3. This specification is updated to accurately reflect the changes in balances and account for both minting and standard transfers without incorrectly asserting that balances aren't decremented when they should be.

These adjustments should address the verification errors while maintaining a proper understanding of the contract behavior.

### Changes Made:
1. Adjusted the postcondition in `safeTransferFrom` to ensure that, if `_from` is not zero, it checks that the new balance is either equal to the old balance (in the case of a zero value transfer) or reduced by `_value`. This accurately reflects the logic of the transfer function.
2. Updated the postcondition for `safeBatchTransferFrom` similarly, ensuring that the transfers can happen properly even when zeros are involved, without the verifier facing ambiguity regarding the conditions expected.
3. Ensured that both functions correctly distinguish between zero transfers, regular transfers, and minting by utilizing the conditions appropriately to avoid incorrect assumptions about state changes possible within the context of any execution. 

With these adjustments, the contract specifications should now validate correctly against the verifier's checks.

### Changes Made:
1. Reworked the postcondition for `safeTransferFrom` to specify that either the balance for `_from` is decreased by `_value`, or it is a zero value transfer, or `_from` is zero when minting. This avoids incorrectly stating that the balance would always decrease without considering edge cases.
2. Updated the postcondition for `safeBatchTransferFrom` to similarly check that the change in balance is properly expressed across all tokens being transferred, allowing for zero values and minting circumstances.
3. The overall structure provides clear checks for conditions relevant to token minting, standard transfers, and zero value transfers, which should help avoid misinterpretations by the verifier.

With these changes, the specifications should close any remaining gaps that caused verification errors.

### Changes Made:
1. Updated the postcondition in `safeTransferFrom` to clarify the conditions that allow for minting (if `_from` is zero and `_value` is greater than zero), proper balance checks for normal transfers, or allow for a zero transfer with no balance change.
2. Adjusted the `safeBatchTransferFrom` postcondition to include checks that accommodate the conditions under which transfers may occur, highlighting when minting or zero value transfers apply.
3. The specifications now accurately reflect the potential states and the necessary adjustments during transfers while preventing assumptions that could lead to verification failures.

These changes cater explicitly to the conditions noted by the verifier, ensuring the semantics of the token transfer logic align with the expectations of the Solidity verifier.
