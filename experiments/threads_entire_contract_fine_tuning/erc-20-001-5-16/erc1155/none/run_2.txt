=== USER [2025-05-30 09:28:03] ===

    
Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Your task is to annotate the functions in the contract below:

The updated postconditions now appropriately reflect that the balances of `_from` must decrease by `_value` during the `safeTransferFrom` function, while ensuring the conditions for `_to` being zero address are properly set. In the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function, it ensures the balances are correctly updated or remains unchanged in other valid scenarios.

    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] memory _ids, uint256[] memory _values) public;

```

In the updated specifications:
- For the `safeTransferFrom` function, the postcondition now states that the balance for `_from` is reduced by `_value` only if `_from` is not the zero address, and considering when `_to` can be the zero address (indicating a burn action).
- For the `safeBatchTransferFrom` function, verification ensures that all balance changes for each `_id` are correctly reflected or not changed when `_from` is the zero address while still allowing for the possibility that the transfer was not valid.

These adjustments help clarify the expectations for state changes in the contract based on the transfer actions performed.

```

In this revised specification:
- For the `safeTransferFrom` function, the postcondition ensures that when the transfer destination is the zero address (indicating a burn), the balance remains unchanged. If the sender is not the zero address, the specified value is deducted, confirming authorized transfers occur correctly from non-zero account holders. 
- For `safeBatchTransferFrom`, the postcondition assures the same logic applies; balances for all tokens being transferred or burned are correctly adjusted, with provisions for cases where the sender is a zero address.

This should resolve the verification conflicts by more accurately reflecting potential outcomes of the state based on input conditions.

In this corrected specification:

1. **`safeTransferFrom` Postcondition:**
    - The postcondition accounts for two scenarios:
      - When `_to` is the zero address, indicating a burn action, so the balance of `_from` remains unchanged.
      - When transferring from one non-zero address to another, and ensures that the balance for `_from` is correctly decremented by `_value`.

2. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` Postcondition:**
    - The postcondition now details that for each transfer, the balance for each token `_ids[i]` must correctly reflect the transfer. It does not include the scenario where `_from` is zero, as the batch transfer does not apply to zero transfers.

These adjustments clarify the expected behavior under valid state transitions, aligning with the typical functionality of ERC1155 transfers. The implementation should now allow for successful verification.

Key changes made:
1. **`safeTransferFrom` Postcondition:**
   - The postcondition now accounts for the correct changes in balance. Specifically, it verifies that when transferring a token `_id` from a non-zero address `_from` to a non-zero address `_to`, the balance of the sender is decremented by `_value`.
   - When `_to` is zero (a burn operation), the sender's balance must remain unchanged.
   - When `_from` is zero and `_to` is also zero, the value should be zero, as transfers cannot happen from a zero address.

2. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` Postcondition:**
   - The postcondition checks balances precisely for each transferred ID, ensuring that they are adjusted correctly during the batch transfer.
   - The conditions assure that balances reflect respective transfers for non-zero addresses.


### Outcome:
These specifications should align securely with the ERC1155 semantics while ensuring that all checks are valid and verifiable according to your contract's state expectations. Make sure to run verification again to ensure compliance.

### Changes Made:

1. **`safeTransferFrom` Postcondition:**
   - The complete specification now covers all possible scenarios:
      - The function allows a transfer when going from valid user accounts and ensures the balance decrement is accurate.
      - It specifically checks that:
        - If both _from and _to are zero and no value is specified, nothing changes.
        - If only _from is zero (the tokens are being minted), no value is deducted.
        - If transferring tokens where _to is zero (tokens are being burned), the balance for _from remains the same, allowing unnecessary transfers to occur.
  
2. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` Postcondition:**
   - Like the previous function, it confirms that when transferring values, it accurately reflects deductions in allowed cases. It confirms that transfers wouldn't decrement the zero address for the from account.

### Outcome:
These adjustments help ensure the expected behavior under all possible conditions and should facilitate the verification process without causing the previously encountered errors. Please run verification tests again with these specifications.

### Adjustments:

1. **`safeTransferFrom` Postcondition:**
   - The conditions allow for the following scenarios:
     - If `_from` is zero and `_to` is also zero while having no value set, no balance is changed.
     - If `_from` is zero and `_to` is not zero, indicating a minting but should also ensure that `_value` is zero.
     - If `_from` is non-zero and `_to` is zero, indicating a burn condition, where the balance for `_from` should remain unchanged.
     - If both `_from` and `_to` are non-zero, it checks that the balance of `_from` is decremented correctly by `_value`.

2. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` Postcondition:**
   - Similar logic applies here, ensuring individuals balances are only decremented under valid conditions while allowing for checks that maintain safe operations for proper addresses.

### Expected Verification Outcome:
These updated postconditions should satisfy the requirements of the verifier with regards to conduct within valid states and safeguard against incorrect behavior. The function should thus run verification successfully.

### Key Modifications:

1. **`safeTransferFrom` Postcondition:**
   - The logic has been simplified to ensure clarity:
     - It now includes checks to ensure balances reflect correctly under several scenarios:
        - If both `_from` and `_to` are zero, the transfer is not executed, and the balance remains unchanged.
        - If the `_from` is zero and `_to` is not, the minting case is indicated, which should not subtract value.
        - If `_from` is valid and `_to` is zero, this indicates a burn situation—the balance should remain unchanged.
        - If both addresses are valid, the balance is decremented as expected.

2. **`safeBatchTransferFrom` Postcondition:**
   - The postcondition now checks that if any balance was transferred from `_from` to `_to`, both addresses must be non-zero. If `_from` is zero, no value should be deducted, confirming mint behavior instead.

### Expected Outcomes:
These changes should address the verification errors you’ve encountered, ensuring all transactions reflect expected outcomes under the ERC1155 standard while accurately representing balances in the case of valid state transitions. Please run this version through your contract verification process.
