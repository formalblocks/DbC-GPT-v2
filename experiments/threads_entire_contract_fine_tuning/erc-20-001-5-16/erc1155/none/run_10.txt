=== USER [2025-05-30 10:34:29] ===

    
Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.
    - Return the entire contract interface, inside ```solidity``` tags, with no implementation code, just the interface with the postconditions added and function signatures.

Your task is to annotate the functions in the contract below:

### Adjustments:

1. **Fixed Quantified Postconditions**: In the specification for `balanceOfBatch` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`, I made sure that quantified conditions are expressed clearly without needing to refer to re-evaluated state. 
2. **Clarified Logical Structure**: For `safeBatchTransferFrom`, I maintained the necessary conditions for each token to follow the format stated in requirements.
  
This adjustment should pass verification while adhering to the stated constraints and clarifications for each function's postconditions.

### Key Changes

1. **Adjusted Quantified Expressions**:
   - For `balanceOfBatch`, I added parenthesis around the quantified condition to prevent syntax errors, making it precise for expected verification.
   - For `safeBatchTransferFrom`, added similar attention to the condition expressions, ensuring that side effects of balance changes per token are well-aligned with syntax expectations.
  
These changes allow the verification process to read them correctly while still aligning with expected behavior of the ERC1155 contract structure.

### Key Changes Made

1. **Fixed Quantified Postcondition Syntax**: 
   - For both `balanceOfBatch` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`, I ensured the quantified postconditions reflect the required relations clearly by making sure logical expressions are clearly demarcated with '==>' only when necessary in the expected context.

2. **Ensured Readability**: 
   - Each `forall` quantification now leads with an implication clearly formed, ensuring that both conditions of postconditions are expressed compactly and avoid any unnecessary confusion during verification.

These changes should help ensure the postconditions are properly recognized and processed by the verification tool.

### Changes Made

1. **Clarification of Postconditions**:
   - For `balanceOfBatch` and `safeBatchTransferFrom`, the postconditions are expressed in logical implications that remove the need for direct implication syntax within the condition.
   - Ensure to define quantifiers properly at the top level, ensuring the summation is properly readable for the verification tool.

These adjustments should further assist the verification process, ensuring clear and correct logical representations that align with the expected results of your contract interactions.

### Key Adjustments Made

1. **Postcondition Syntax**:
   - For `safeBatchTransferFrom`, I modified the postcondition to distinctly define the required condition for balance updates that depend on the old state. Specifically, it checks if the old balance meets the minimum required before performing the update.
   - The condition now expresses a clear relationship between previous and current states without without negations or unnecessary logical complications, ensuring that the implication is implicitly preserved.

2. **Cleaner Expressions**:
   - Made sure to correct Any logical fallacies in how they relate to ERC standards while clearly aligning to how balances are updated within the scope of the function.

This refined structure should provide clarity, correctness, and support for verification by directly defining conditions that represent what needs to occur after function execution.

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Fixed Quantification Logic**:
   - The quantification condition in `safeBatchTransferFrom` specifies that for each index `i`, if the old balance is greater than or equal to the value being transferred, the balances will be updated accordingly. This structure guarantees clarity and aligns with logical expectations: only under the right conditions should adjustment happen.

2. **Clarity in Conditions**:
   - Made explicit that balance conditions reflect the correct relationship between token counts before and after updating.

These modifications address the issues previously flagged, ensuring that the postconditions clearly represent the intended behavior of the contract in a verifiable manner, while maintaining adherence to ERC1155 standards.

### Key Adjustments Made

1. **Revised Postcondition for `safeBatchTransferFrom`**:
   - The postcondition now explicitly shows that if the balance before the transfer is less than the value attempted to be transferred, it does not enforce the balance change condition. Instead, it ensures that either the balance update occurs correctly or the precondition can allow a transfer attempt that does not subtract from the `_from` balance.
   - This allows for correctly capturing cases when a transfer should not reject the transaction when the original balance is insufficient, hence avoiding misinterpretation by the verifier.

These adjustments ensure the contract specifications meet the nuanced requirements of conditions expected when defining `ERC1155` implementations while facilitating clearer verification without logical run-time conflicts.

            Can you fix the specification accordingly?

### Key Modifications:

1. **Adjustment of Quantified Conditions**: 
   - In the `safeBatchTransferFrom` specification, the postcondition appropriately ensures that balance deductions on `_from` and increments on `_to` only occur when sufficient balance exists before the transfer.
   - Specifically, I specified the statement to read that balance changes only take place if the original balance allows for the subtraction to go through smoothly. This addresses logical flow in transfers more explicitly.

2. **Conditional Formatting**: 
   - The logical flow utilizes implications to ensure both success in transfers and reflects the permission-based approach whereby balances are changed conditionally based upon prior states. 

These revisions aim to ensure that the specification model used is both correct and clear, aligning with ERC1155 logic while enabling verification.
