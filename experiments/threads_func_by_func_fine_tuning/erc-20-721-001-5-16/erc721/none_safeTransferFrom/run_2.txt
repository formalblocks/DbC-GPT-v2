=== USER [2025-09-12 13:29:48] ===
Task:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax (`/// @notice postcondition condition`). Postconditions must not end with a semicolon (";").
    - You MUST use the EIP documentation below to understand the required behavior.
    - Replace `$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE` with appropriate postconditions above each function. Postconditions placed below the function signature are invalid. For instance:
    ```/// @notice postcondition condition1\n
    /// @notice postcondition condition2\n
    function foo(uint256 bar, address par) public;```
    - Return ONLY what is inside the <postconditions>...</postconditions> block.

Requirements:
    - Ensure conditions correctly represent the expected state changes and return values.
    - View functions should relate return values directly to state variables.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use state variables exactly as declared. Referencing undeclared variables will fail if they aren't in the contract. For instance, a state variable `uint256 var` can be referenced as `var` only.
    - Postconditions MUST ONLY use parameter names exactly as they appear in function signatures. For instance, `function foo(uint256 bar,  address par)` has parameter names `bar` and `par` only. 
    - Use `__verifier_old_uint(stateVariable)` or `__verifier_old_bool(stateVariable)` to reference values from the start of the function execution.
    - A quantified postcondition MUST start with `forall`. For instance, a quantified postcondition look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint x) condition`. Without the `forall` at the beginning, the postcondition is invalid.
    - YOU MUST SPECIFY THE RANGE when postconditions quantify over arrays. For example, for array `arr` a postcondition quantification would look like `/// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition`. Without the range, the postcondition is likely to be invalid.
    - The implication operator "==>" is not valid in solc-verify notation, so it must appear NOWHERE in a postcondition. For instance, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition condition1 ==> condition2` is invalid. Similarly, a postcondition of the form `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` is also invalid. You can use instead the notation `!(condition) || condition2` to simulate the implication operator. For instance, `/// @notice postcondition (forall uint x) condition1 ==> condition2` can be written as `/// @notice postcondition !(condition1) || condition2`.


OUTPUT FORMAT:
<postconditions>
/// @notice postcondition ...
/// @notice postcondition ...
</postconditions>

Your task is to annotate the function in the contract below:


```solidity
pragma solidity >= 0.5.0;

contract ERC721 {
// Mapping from token ID to owner
mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenOwner;

// Mapping from token ID to approved address
mapping (uint256 => address) private _tokenApprovals;

// Mapping from owner to number of owned token
mapping (address => uint256) private _ownedTokensCount;

// Mapping from owner to operator approvals
mapping (address => mapping (address => bool)) private _operatorApprovals;

/// @notice Transfers the ownership of an NFT from one address to another address
/// @dev This works identically to the other function with an extra data parameter,
/// except this function just sets data to "".
/// @param _from The current owner of the NFT
/// @param _to The new owner
/// @param _tokenId The NFT to transfer

$ADD POSTCONDITION HERE
function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes memory _data) public;
}
```
