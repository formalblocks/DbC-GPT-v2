=== USER [2025-08-29 14:32:19] ===
TASK:
    - You are given a smart contract interface and need to add formal postconditions to a function using solc-verify syntax.
    - Postconditions MUST start with: /// @notice postcondition ...
    - Postconditions MUST NOT end with a semicolon (";").
    - Return ONLY what is inside the <postconditions>...</postconditions> block.

RULES:
    1. Use ONLY declared state variables exactly as written in the contract.
    2. Use ONLY parameter names exactly as written in the function signature.
    3. For old values, use __verifier_old_uint(stateVariable) or __verifier_old_bool(stateVariable).
    4. Quantified postconditions MUST start with 'forall' and MUST define the iteration range:
       /// @notice postcondition forall (uint i) !(0 <= i && i < arr.length) || condition
    5. The implication operator "==>" is NOT valid. Replace with logical form:
       !(condition1) || condition2
    6. One postcondition per line, placed directly ABOVE the target function signature.
    7. Do not include explanations, comments, or natural language outside postconditions.

POSITIVE EXAMPLES (Abstract / ERC-Agnostic):
<postconditions>
/// @notice postcondition mappingVar[key] == value
/// @notice postcondition value != address(0)
</postconditions>

<postconditions>
/// @notice postcondition __verifier_old_uint(counter) + delta == counter
/// @notice postcondition mappingVar[user] == __verifier_old_uint(mappingVar[user]) - delta
</postconditions>

OUTPUT FORMAT:
<postconditions>
/// @notice postcondition ...
/// @notice postcondition ...
</postconditions>

Your task is to annotate the function in the contract below:



Function-Type Hint: This is a read-only function. Postconditions must tie return values directly to state variables. Do NOT describe state changes, since no state can be modified.
