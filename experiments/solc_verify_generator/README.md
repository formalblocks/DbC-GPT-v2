The beginning of the work on a tool to generate the files we need for training our model.

We have some artifacts to generate a merge contract and the elements to run this contract on solc-verify.

## solc-verify

To build the docker image run ``./build.sh``

To build run a contract on solc-verify run ``./run.sh $name_of_contract``

### How to Install solc Versions
To install and manage different versions of the Solidity compiler (solc), follow these steps:

1. Install solc-select:
   ```
    pip3 install solc-select
   ```
2. Install a specific version of solc (e.g., 0.5.0):
    ```
    solc-select install 0.5.0
    ```
3. Use the installed version:
    ```
    solc-select use 0.5.0
    ```

## generating contracts for solc-verify

To generate the merge contract for ERC20, one can run:

``python3 solc-verify-generator.py "./ERC20/spec.sol" "./ERC20/templates/imp_spec_merge.template" "./ERC20/imp/ERC20_merge.sol"``

In the ERC20 folder we have all the artifacts that we need for our ERC20 training: there is a specification (spec.sol), the eip (eip.md), and an implementation in (imp). Inside this implementation folder, we have also a template for a merge contract (ERC20_merge.template) for the ERC20 reference implementation we have at hand. 

The script ``solc-verify-generator.py`` takes into the account the template and the specification and generates a merge contract (see ``solc-verify-generator.py --help`` for more details on the parameters necessary and what they mean).

The folder ``temp`` is where we leave the AST generated by the compiler that we use to parse the specification --- this generation is done automatically by the solc-verify-generator tool.
