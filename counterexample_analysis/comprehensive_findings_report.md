## 2. Base Model Context Impact Analysis (4o-mini)

### Context-Dependent Performance Patterns

| Context Type | Success Rate | First-Time Success | Loop Useful | Avg Iterations | Evidence |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **Multi-Context + Same** | 97.8% | 78.9% | 18.9% | 0.39 | Optimal performance |

### Critical Copying Behavior Evidence

**ERC-20 & ERC-721 Contracts:**
- **No Context**: 0% first-time success
- **Same-Type Context**: 100% first-time success
- **Improvement**: +100 percentage points
- **Conclusion**: Clear specification copying behavior

**ERC-1155 Contract:**
- **Both Scenarios**: 0% first-time success
- **Conclusion**: More complex standard resistant to simple copying

### Base Model Behavioral Insights
1. **Extreme Context Dependency**: 84.5 percentage point difference between best (97.8%) and worst (13.3%) context scenarios
2. **Perfect Copying Signature**: 100% first-time success with same-type context vs 0% without context for ERC-20/721
3. **Limited Reasoning Capability**: Pure model capability (no context) achieves only 13.3% success rate
4. **Context Optimization**: Multi-context including same type yields optimal results (97.8% success)

## 3. Fine-Tuning Model Analysis

### Performance Characteristics

| Model Category | Success Rate | First-Time Success Rate | Loop Useful Rate | Avg Iterations |
|---------------|-------------|------------------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Base Model (4o-mini)** | 58.8% | 37.9% | 20.8% | 0.67 |
| **Fine-Tuned Models** | 35.7% | 2.4% | 33.3% | Higher variance |

### Fine-Tuning Model Patterns
- **Iteration Dependency**: Fine-tuned models show much lower first-time success (2.4% vs 37.9%)
- **Higher Loop Utilization**: 33.3% of runs benefit from iterative refinement vs 20.8% for base model
- **Specialization Effects**: Models fine-tuned on specific standards show targeted improvements
- **Cross-Contract Performance**: Fine-tuned models often struggle when applied to different contract types

### Top Performing Fine-Tuned Models
1. **erc-20-721-1155-001-5-16**: 10 first-time successes (multi-standard training)
2. **erc-1155-001-5-16**: 4 first-time successes (ERC-1155 specialist)
3. **erc-20-1155-001-5-16**: 4 first-time successes (dual-standard training)

## 4. Comparative Model Behavior Analysis

### Base Model vs Fine-Tuned Models

| Aspect | Base Model (4o-mini) | Fine-Tuned Models |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Primary Strategy** | Context copying | Iterative refinement |
| **First-Time Success** | High with context (78.9%) | Low overall (2.4%) |
| **Context Dependency** | Extreme (84.5pp difference) | Moderate |
| **Loop Utilization** | Lower (20.8%) | Higher (33.3%) |
| **Specialization** | General with context help | Task-specific knowledge |
| **Robustness** | Context-dependent | More consistent iteration |

### Behavioral Mechanisms
- **Base Model**: Leverages reference specification copying when available, struggles without context
- **Fine-Tuned Models**: Embed domain knowledge but require refinement iterations to achieve accuracy
- **Complementary Strengths**: Base excels with proper context, fine-tuned models provide specialized reasoning

## Conclusion

This comprehensive analysis provides definitive evidence for the value of iterative refinement in LLM-based formal verification while revealing critical differences in model behavior patterns. The base model's extreme context dependency and copying behavior contrasts sharply with fine-tuned models' iteration-dependent reasoning approach.

**Key Takeaway**: Success in LLM-based formal verification depends heavily on matching the right model approach with appropriate context strategies, with iterative refinement serving as a crucial capability multiplier across all approaches.

**Recommendation**: Deploy hybrid systems that leverage base model copying capabilities with high-quality context while maintaining fine-tuned model refinement capabilities for complex cases requiring genuine reasoning.
